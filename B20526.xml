            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>GOD having been pleaſed to bring us forth in ſuch an Age of the world, wherein we have ſeen, through mercy, not only his work of power in dethroning of unrighteous men; but likewiſe in a meaſure the ariſing of the Son of Righteouſneſs with <hi>healing in his wings;</hi> and, I truſt, <hi>to take to himſelf his great Kingdom, and to reign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The buſineſs committed to you (by and next to the Supreme Authority of the Nation) being of very great concernment, and indeed that which relates to him who is the moſt Supreme, He who is <hi>Lord of Lords, and King of Kings:</hi> Notwithſtanding I find there have been many Propoſals unto your Honours, it might be altogether needleſs for ſuch a one as I to propoſe any thing unto your Wiſdoms; yet not doubting your willingneſs to hear what the weakeſt may propound in this great buſineſs, <hi>though by it nothing be added to you;</hi> I providentially and occaſionally coming to this City, could not with good conſcience depart from hence without preſenting ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unto your Honours, as to the thing in hand. If in it, to you or any others, I do appear <hi>a fool,</hi> let me be excuſed; I have performed in this my duty both to my Lord and you. My deſire is, that the former preſidents of miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages in changing times, may be a warning unto us, <hi>viz.</hi> The plucking up of one Form, and planting of another by the Magiſterial power. <hi>Every plant that the Heavenly Father hath not planted, muſt be plucked up.</hi> My deſire is, not to be tedious: but in a word, out of tenderneſs to the honour of the Lord Jeſus, and the Authority of the Nation, that there may be given to <hi>GOD</hi> thoſe things that are his, and to <hi>Caeſar</hi> thoſe things that are his, have I humbly preſented theſe following Propoſals unto your Honours.</p>

            <p n="1"> 1. <hi>Whether or no</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>be not the alone Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual King in and over all Caſes of Conſcience relating to Worſhip?</hi> Pſal. 2. Rev. 15. 3, 4. Act. 3. 22, 23. Mat. 28. 18.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Whether he hath ſurrendred up any part of this Authority to any Civil Magiſtrate under the Goſpel?</hi> Jam. 4. 11, 12. Rom. 14. 4.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Whether, becauſe the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Magiſtracie, according to the command of God, took cogniſance of ſuch things, they with all the reſt of their Ordinances being typical in their anointing, power and rule, &amp;c. it being all ſwallowed up into Chriſt the ſubſtance, he being the alone King of his people; be any ground for Magiſtrates now to do the like?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Whether to do the like, be not to deny Chriſt to be come in the fleſh, and to deny his Kingly Authority?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Whether the work of the Magiſtrate, as a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, do not primely relate to the bodies of men, and things of this world; that ſo they may be for the praiſe of them that do well, and for the puniſhment of evil doers?</hi> Rom. 13.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Whether it be not the work whereunto God hath called them, to protect all that live peaceably and civilly, in obedience to the Civil Law of the Nation; and to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and protect the Servants of the Lord alike, in the Preaching and profeſsing the Goſpel, though differing in their apprehenſions; leaving the judgment of Caſes of Conſcience unto Chriſt, as before?</hi>

               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Having ſo ſuddenly, and almoſt unexpectedly brought forth this Treatiſe to publique view, Plainneſs and brevity thou mayſt find in it, though but little of that excellencie which mans wiſdom teacheth; yet ſomething of the truth of Jeſus mayſt thou find there, in the plain evidence of the Spirit and power of truth. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thou ſeeſt many differences in the world about the worſhip of God, it behoves thee ſo much the more to querie after it; for it is the duty of thoſe who have an intereſt in Chriſt, to do his will: <hi>If ye love me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>keep my commandments,</hi> Joh. 14. 15. and that is the way to attain an increaſe in the knowledge of the will of God, <hi>viz.</hi> a doing of what we know, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7 17.</p>
            <p>I have here preſented to thy view ſeveral Replies unto ſeveral Men and Things. Firſt to the <hi>Font-guarded;</hi> wherein you have, gathered up all the Arguments of former Writers, eſpecially Mr. <hi>Baxters,</hi> and drawn into 20 Arguments. To all which I have given a brief Reply; and although brief, yet I queſtion not but with ſuch plainneſs and clearneſs, as that he that runs may read: and in it through mercy thou mayſt come to ſee the clear difference between <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Covenant of the Law and the Covenant of the Goſpel: the ordinances, miniſtry and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of the one, and of the other: and becauſe God hath made me publike in the profeſſion of his truth, I judge my ſelf bound in conſcience, and duty to Jeſus Chriſt, to vindicate that truth I profeſs: every command and truth of Jeſus being, to a lover of the truth, more precious then that of gold; and although hither unto I have and may ſtill expect to paſs through many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches for the ſake of Chriſt, through good and bad report; yet I weigh it not; none of theſe things trouble me: it was the portion of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and <hi>if they called the maſter of the houſe Beelzebub, what will they not do to the ſervant?</hi> I truſt, that notwithſtanding the rudeneſs and rage of thoſe men who ſeek themſelves, yet God hath hitherto ſo kept and carried me, that I may ſay truly, <hi>I have endeavoured to keep a Conſcience void of offence both before God and men.</hi> And as to thoſe Principles of Truth by me owned, although judged by men, yet my
<pb facs="tcp:199222:5"/> judgement is with the Lord, and he knows the way of his People, but the way of the wicked ſhall periſh. Though I paſs under the cenſure of <hi>Tho. Hall,</hi> whom nothing but Fire and Fagot can ſatisfie, and under the ignominious reproaches of <hi>Feriby, Sanders,</hi> and a thouſand more, yet none of theſe things trouble me; and let none think that I am beſides my ſelf, becauſe I thus profeſs and write: for if I am it is to the Lord, and for your ſakes, for whom my deſire is, that you may be made partaker of the truth, and that as it is in <hi>Jeſus; not after the will of men, but of God.</hi> I have preſented to thy conſideration theſe two things. Firſt, the inſufficiency of all thoſe grounds produced for Infant-Baptiſm, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in its weakneſs and inconſiſtency with the Goſpel will appear; and the continued practice of the baptizing of Believers cleared and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A brief Reply to <hi>John Feriby,</hi> and <hi>Richard Sanders:</hi> wherein you may finde a farther confirmation of the truth aſſerted in the <hi>Pulpit-Guard Routed,</hi> viz. the lawfulneſs of the Preaching of Gifted Brethren.</p>
            <p>I have likewiſe three things to deſire of the Reader.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To read and judge: Read, and conſider what thou readeſt; for I have endeavoured to compoſe much in few words, and that becauſe I judged it to be for thy profit, large Diſcourſes being ſometimes not ſo uſefull: therefore, I ſay, be content to ſpare a little time to conſider, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template upon what thou readeſt, and happily thou mayeſt come to ſee all thoſe ſtrong Guards broken and diſperſt, as the morning dew before the Sun.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Read with patience; and be not troubled at that which may ſeem to thee to be harſh language, or contrary to thy underſtanding: and this I aſſure thee, conſidering the Spirits of thoſe men with whom I have had to deal, I have paſſed through with as much moderation as poſſibly I could, without betraying the Cauſe; and giving but a word of reproof to an inſulting adverſary.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Read and judge impartially; lean not to the right hand or to the left, for affection ſake, but deſire the Lord, from an impartial unbyaſt heart, to lead thee into the truth, reſolve not to follow the traditions of men or Churches, but the written word of Truth, which is able to give thee direction as a rule of life through the bleſſing of the Spirit of Jeſus, and to make the man of God perfect, throughly furniſhing him to every good work</p>

But Sir, by the way, it ſeems you are become an abſolute Souldier, a grand Captain, Leader. But whats the work? To guard <hi>Pulpits</hi> and <hi>Fonts</hi> forſooth. I ſuppoſe you'l be cautious of ſuffering much in defence of your Cauſe; if you had intended it, you would not have ſet your guards about that which none intends to take from you that I know of: But is it truth in good earneſt that your <hi>Font</hi> is affronted?</p>
            <p n="1">1. I wonder you had not had more wiſdom and forecaſt in you at firſt, and have ſet your Guard round about your Kirk; ſo one might have ſerved for the whole, and have ſaved you much labour and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of time: but I ſuppoſe your wiſdom lay in this; You guarded the <hi>Pulpit</hi> firſt, that ſo being routed there, you might have a fair re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat to the holy <hi>Font;</hi> and when routed there, you might ſound ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther retreat, but whither I know not, unleſs to the high Altar, <hi>viz.</hi> the Communion Table (ſo called) or into the Belfrey, to ſecure the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:199222:6"/> holy baptized Bels; In Pope <hi>Johns</hi> time the 14. began the vile ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition of baptizing Bels; <hi>Simpſons</hi> Hiſtory of the Church, <hi>Cent.</hi> 10.

            <p>But 3. Did you ever read in Scripture of the <hi>Font,</hi> or of baptizing in the <hi>Font?</hi> I know you have not.

               <p>I anſwer: Firſt, your <hi>Minor</hi> is denyed, That Children of Believers are in the Covenant of grace; and here lies the ground of your miſcarriage, ignorance, and error in this particular. We will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore come firſt to conſider the Covenant it ſelf, which is the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on which you ſtand, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17 7, 10, 11. This Covenant it ſelf is wholly outward, and it conſiſts of two parts; the one on Gods part to be performed, the other on <hi>Abrahams</hi> and his childrens part.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:199222:6"/> That on Gods is in <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8. <hi>I will be a God to thee, and to thy ſeed after thee; and I will give unto thee, and to thy ſeed after thee the Land of thy ſojourning, all the Land of Canaan for an everlaſting poſſeſſion, and will be their God,</hi> This Covenant is outward, and conſiſts of an outward promiſe, <hi>The Land of Canaan, &amp;c.</hi> and is not in it ſelf the everlaſting Covenant of grace: Its true, there is grace in this Covenant, yet it is not the Covenant of grace; there is grace in this, for it is grace for God declaratively to be a God to a People. And ſecondly, there was the everlaſting grace included typically in this Covenant, for it relates in the myſterie unto Chriſt, as all outward Covenants, Services, and the Land of Canaan it ſelf did, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 6 <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. from <hi>ver.</hi> 3. to the 8. That it was an outward Covenant, will appear. 1. The thing promiſed in the Covenant was outward <hi>i. e.</hi> The Land of Canaan.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>He promiſed to be a God unto them in an everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This was a promiſe in an outward Covenant, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. 22, 23. compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 29. <hi>Though the Children of Iſrael be as the ſand of the ſea, yet a remnant of them ſhall be ſaved:</hi> Now if God had been a God unto them in the Covenant of grace, they muſt have been all ſaved, and have continued in that Covenant unto this day; but it being but an outward and typical Covenant, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to Chriſt the antitype and ſubſtance; when Chriſt was come, that Covenant was diſſolved into Chriſt, and is given forth upon the true ſpiritual account, to the ſpiritual ſeed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16. with 29.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Its ſaid to be <hi>an everlaſting Covenant,</hi> either 1. becauſe it was to continue its appointed time, ſo called Everlaſting, as uſually the old Teſtament Ordinances were: ſo God promiſed in this Covenant to give the Land of Canaan for an everlaſting poſſeſſion: yet they are, and have been many hundreds of years turned out of it; and if they had not, yet that could but have been a poffeſſion for them in their generations till the end of the world. But the Covenant of grace rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to eternity, without end, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 17. Hence the Prieſthood of the Law was called an everlaſting Prieſthood. <hi>Exod.</hi> 40. 15. <hi>Num.</hi> 25. 13. Or ſecondly, its called Everlaſting, upon the account of Chriſt, who was the ſubſtance, and the Covenant it ſelf when he came, ending all other Covenants and Services, <hi>Iſa</hi> 42. 6. So <hi>Davids</hi> Kingdom was ſaid to be Everlaſting, upon the account of Chriſt, who was, and is the true ſpiritual King, of whom <hi>David</hi> was a type. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 16. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 89. 35, 36. compared with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 24, 25. <hi>David</hi> was dead long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:199222:7"/> yet <hi>David,</hi> viz. <hi>Chriſt,</hi> muſt be their <hi>King for ever.</hi> Thus it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears firſt from the Covenant it ſelf on Gods part, that it was not the Covenant of grace, though grace was darkly and typically included in it, only the enlightened renewed ſoul ſaw into it, and partaked of Chriſt the ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, it will appear likewiſe if we conſider the ſecond part of the Covenant on <hi>Abraham</hi> and his childrens part: <hi>Every man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child ſhall be circumciſed at eight dayes old,</hi> v. 10. 11, 12. Here is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal obedience ſuitable to an external covenant: God promiſeth the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> in lieu of this they muſt be circumciſed, which ſhall be a ſign of their obedience, and to God of his Covenant, as the Rain-bow in another caſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Covenant being thus conſidered, it followeth, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this Covenant was to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed natural, yet it is not to Believers now and their ſeed natural. This denies your <hi>Minor,</hi> and this Scripture produced by you doth not prove it. Your other Scripture <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 39. I ſhall anſwer in its place, when I come to your Argument drawn from it. And whereas you ſay, <hi>That there are ſome Infants in the Covenant of grace,</hi> I deny it poſitively that there are Infants in the Covenant of grace upon your account, <hi>viz.</hi> the account of nature, becauſe born of believing parents; all fleſhly boaſting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 27. As the Covenant to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed was outward and typical; ſo the Covenant of Chriſt, or Chriſt the Covenant is to the ſpiritual ſeed, and that only; thoſe who are of the ſaith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who <hi>do the works of Abraham,</hi> they, and they only are the ſeed of <hi>Abraham, Joh.</hi> 8. 39. <hi>He is not a Jew that is one outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but he is a Jew that is one inwardly, Rom.</hi> 2. 28, 29. where as the outward Covenant, ſo the natural ſeed are cut off, and only the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſtands. And whereas you ſay, there is an outward being in this Covenant, &amp;c. <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was circumcjſed: I ſay ſo too; for in it ſelf it was wholly outward; this and all other Covenants and ſervices were outward and typical, except the firſt promiſe <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace now in the dayes of Chriſt, is wholly ſpiritual. Thoſe then that were enlightened, which were but few, ſaw and enjoyed the ſubſtance in the ſhadow and form; We firſt the ſubſtance, and with it the form: They were firſt brought by works to Chriſt; we firſt to Chriſt, and then to works as fruits of faith.</p>
               <p>And whereas you conclude Baptiſm to be <hi>a Seal of the Covenant of Grace,</hi> you are as much beſides the truth in this, as in the Covenant it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:199222:7"/> ſelf. Becauſe you have heard others ſay it, therefore you affirm it too, as children uſe to ſpeak by tradition: but where is your Scripture for it? Did you ever read of any New-Teſtament ſeal, beſides the Spirit of Chriſt? <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>ch.</hi> 4. 30. But I ſuppoſe becauſe that it's ſaid <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. that <hi>Abraham received the ſign of Circumciſion, a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of his faith</hi> which he had before he was circumciſed, that therefore <hi>Baptiſm is a ſeal of the Covenant of grace:</hi> Oh groſs miſtake! <hi>Abraham</hi> believed God when he firſt promiſed him the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and commanded him to forſake all and go into it, and that he would keep him and bleſs him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. Here <hi>Abraham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved God, and obeyed, and went out <hi>not knowing whither;</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 17. God gave him Circumciſion a ſign and ſeal to confirm his faith, which he had before in this promiſe. And as Circumciſion was given a ſeal of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith in Gods promiſing him the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> ſo the Spirt of grace is the ſeal of faith to every believer of his intereſt in the ſpiritual land, the ſubſtance of the outward, the Lord Jeſus. So you are loſt both in Covenant, in Seal, in the Subjects of the Covenant and all.</p>
               <p>You mention <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 28. I ſay, upon the Goſpel-account its truth, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was heir to that Covenant, ſo all true believers are heirs of the true promiſe, and none elſe. Whereas you ſay <hi>pag.</hi> 11. in way of anſwer to an objection, <hi>That theirs is old, and ended &amp;c.</hi> you anſwer, <hi>That to make that old, none but carnal Anabaptiſts will do it.</hi> Your mouth is wide, but let it paſs. I anſwer, To make that Covenant which was of an outward land, the ſame as ours which is of a ſpiritual land; to bring in the natural ſeed upon that account, when it is only to the ſpiritual ſeed, none but a carnal and blind generation of men dare to do. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 24 <hi>God is a Spirit, and they that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him muſt worſhip in ſpirit and in truth, and ſuch the Father ſeeks to worſhip him.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt came forth from the Father for that end, that he might gain a ſpiritual people to worſhip: but your great work is to get in a natural people, a carnal people, the fleſhly ſeed; ſo contradicting the end of God in giving Chriſt: upholding the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moſes;</hi> ſo denying Chriſt to be come in the fleſh: I will not ſay, at preſent, for your own ends and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts.</p>
               <p>The force of your firſt Argument being thus untwiſted, and its weakneſs and invalidity laid open, I need not trace you in your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels: what I have already written, puts an end to your Parallels, as

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. You ſay, <hi>They are under the ſame Covenant.</hi> That is denied, and raſed in my Anſwer to your former argument: It is neither the ſame Covenant, nor the ſame ſeal; an outward ſeal to an outward Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, an inward ſeal to an inward Covenant.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:199222:8"/>
               <p n="2">2. You ſay, <hi>There is the ſame reaſon for the one as for the other: our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are born in original ſin as well as theirs, &amp; have the ſame need of the ſeal.</hi> Oh unimaginable blindneſs! was Circumciſion or Baptiſm either ever given to ſeal up the pardon of original ſin? If it was, then it muſt be pardoned, or not pardoned: if pardoned, then ſure; elſe it is but the putting a ſeal to a blank. But the truth is, they were never given ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them upon that account, or for that end, to ſeal up the pardon of original ſin. And whereas you ſay there is the ſame reaſon for the one as for the other, it is denied; for the command of God is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the one and of the other; God commanded Infants to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, he hath commanded Believers to be baptized; and 'tis reaſon that he ſhould be obeyed as in the firſt, ſo in the ſecond; it's an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable and wicked thing to contradict by contrary actions the commands of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You ſay, <hi>If Baptiſm ſucceed in the place of Circumciſion, then Baptiſm belongs to thoſe to whom Circumciſion did belong. But Baptiſm doth ſucceed in the place of Circumciſion.</hi> Ergo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, your <hi>Minor</hi> is denied. 1. There is no Scripture that ſaith that Baptiſm was ordained in the place of <hi>Circumciſion;</hi> it's your own invention, never mentioned by the Apoſtles of Chriſt. The Scriptures you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38, 39. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11, 12. have not the leaſt hint in them to the thing in hand, and are abundantly abuſed and wreſted to that for which they were never intended, as will appear. 2. You confeſs that <hi>Baptiſm was in force before Circumciſion was aboliſhed.</hi> Circumciſion and Baptiſm ſtood both in force by a Law for ſome years, at leaſt 3 or 4 years. Now if Baptiſm had come in the room of Circumciſion, then Circumciſion muſt have ceaſed when Baptiſm came: But Circumciſion did not ceaſe when Baptiſm came; Therefore Baptiſm came not in the room of it. If it be objected, that <hi>Paul</hi> circumciſed <hi>Timothy</hi> after the aſcenſion of Chriſt; I anſwer, that was becauſe of the <hi>Jewes</hi> for their weakneſs: but it was in being by the Law of God untill the death of Chriſt. So then I reaſon thus: That which put an end to Circumciſion, came in the room of Circumciſion; but Chriſt put an end to Circumciſion, therefore he is come in the room of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. That it was Chriſt, and not Baptiſm that put an end to Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, is cleer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2, 3. So that Baptiſm did not put an end to Circumciſion, but Chriſt did; therefore Baptiſm came not in the room of Circumciſion. 3. It could not come in the room of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion to them that never had Circumciſion: but women were
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:199222:9"/> never circumciſed, the Gentiles were never circumciſed; and it could not come in the room of Circumciſion to thoſe which never were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed. But you will ſay that women were virtually circumciſed in the men, &amp;c. And why are they not baptized virtually in the men too? if you will take your rule from Circumciſion, let them be baptized in the men too. 4. There is no parity, but a diſparity between Baptiſm and Circumciſion, as your ſelf in ſome things have noted. 1. In the action, 2. in the time, 3. in the ſubject, 4. in the end. Firſt, in the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that was the cutting of the foreskin of the fleſh, which occaſioned blood; this of Baptiſm a dipping into or under water. Secondly, for the time; that was to be done at eight dayes old, this of Baptiſm when the party deſireth it, profeſſing faith and repentance to the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the Church, be when it will. Thirdly, for the ſubject; that was the Male only, this of Baptiſm is to be adminiſtred on both men and women, profeſſing faith in our Lord Jeſus, and repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. Fourthly, for the end, that is far wide, as will appear in this enſuing Parallel.</p>

               <p>Theſe things conſidered, there is neither probability, reaſon, or Scripture for the coming of Baptiſm in the room of Circumciſion. Firſt, there is no Scripture for it: when falſe Apoſtles went about to bring in Circumciſion, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. the Apoſtle never mentions Baptiſm at all; if it had come in the room of Circumciſion, they might eaſily have ſtopped their mouths with this; You have Baptiſm in the room of it, what need you trouble your ſelves ſo much? But they never made uſe of this as an anſwer; therefore its evident that it came not in the room of it. 2. It was in being together. 3. It could not be ſo to them that were never circumciſed. And 4. there being no parity between them, I adde 5. If you will have it in the room of ſomething, why might it not come in the room of thoſe Legal waſhings that were amongſt the Jews, as well as in the room
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:199222:9"/> of Circumciſion? there is a parity in the one, and likelier in the end too, but none in the other; their Religion <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Jews,</hi> conſiſted in divers waſhings, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. ſo that if you muſt of neceſſity have it to come in the room of any thing, why not in the room of thoſe waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? Yet I do not believe that it came in the room of this or any other legal Ordinance; but that God gave what Ordinances he pleaſed to that miniſtration, and Jeſus Chriſt gave what Ordinances he pleaſed to this miniſtration: not one Ordinance putting out the other; but Chriſt being the end of all, gives out new upon his own account.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, put caſe what you ſay were truth, that it were come in the room of Circumciſion, which can never be proved either from Scripture or reaſon; yet what will this help you? We are, or profeſs our ſelves to be Chriſts ſervants: then hearken to him, and obey his voice; receive the Law from his mouth, for he is the Meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts. Let Chriſt be King; give but ſo much honour to him as to inform you who is to be baptized, and the time when it is to be done, &amp; the manner how, and the controverſie will be ſoon ended. The truth of the buſineſs being thus conſidered, your Aſſertion and yout Parallels I leave to the conſideration of the underſtanding Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſo purſue you to your third Argument.</p>

               <p>This Argument is eaſily anſwered, only it's ſtated confuſedly; if you intend by the command for ſigning Believers children, that of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, as I ſuppoſe you do, then I think that is repealed and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, for the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> that if they be <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit them nothing at all.</hi> And if you deny this truth, we may well take the Apoſtles advice, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>Beware of the conciſion; for we are the Circumciſion, who worſhip God in the Spirit, &amp;c.</hi> If you by the ſign intend Baptiſm, you had done well to ſhew where it was commanded to Infants; and if nowhere commanded, then no need of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:199222:10"/> 
                  <hi>repealing</hi> or <hi>forbidding.</hi> If you intend that Baptiſm was commanded in Circumciſion, that hath been anſwered already; and it is but a whimſie of your own head, there hath not been any Scripture yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for the confirmation of it, nor ever is like to be: all you ſay in this, is but the ſubſtance of what you have ſaid already; you dance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in a line, and are gotten no further yet then in your former Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; it's juſt the old Proverb, <hi>A great cry, and a little wooll.</hi> Truly, if you did know and love the Lord Jeſus, you could not, you would not dare to go back to lay the foundation of Goſpel ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Legal inſtitutions; but you would look to Chriſt, and hearken what he hath ſaid; and believe it, every one that refuſeth to look to him, ſhall be cut off from among his people, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 22, 23.</p>
               <p>You ſay, <hi>Let any man ſhew if he can, when where, and how this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was abrogated.</hi> I anſwer, it was abrogated and repealed in Chriſt: that as all the Services, Ceremonies, Covenants, <hi>Canaan,</hi> Natural ſeed, and all was typical; ſo Chriſt is the body and ſubſtance of all theſe ſervices, ceremonies &amp;c. and the ſpiritual people, believers, are the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance typed out in the natural ſeed. So that as the natural ſeed were accounted for the ſeed, that is repealed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 39, 44. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 28, 29. and only the ſpiritual are accounted for the ſeed.</p>
               <p>You talk much of priviledge, as if baptizing of Infants were ſuch a priviledge to them. I anſwer, 1. Our priviledges do not conſiſt in externals; but as the Covenant was made with the ſpiritual ſeed, ſo the priviledges of the Covenant are ſuitable to it; ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. from the 6. verſe to the end. And truly it bewrayes abundance of ignorance in thoſe that cry out ſo much about priviledge, as if the priviledge of the Covenant of grace conſiſted ſo much in outſide things. What privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it was to the <hi>Jews</hi> to be circumciſed, I know not, I mean to thoſe who were never circumciſed in their hearts; or what priviledge it is to Infants to be baptized, I wonder, unleſs you will make it a priviledge to be in the form without the power, and ſo to make ſouls think themſelves Chriſtians when they are none, ſo deceiving and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding them. Certainly this will be but a ſad priviledge one day, when both teachers and taught muſt give an account together. I could ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be freely willing to part even with tears of blood, in ſight and ſenſe of thoſe many thouſands, yea millions of ſouls deeply deluded with pretended priviledges, who think themſelves in a good conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in a moment go down to hell. <hi>For the wicked muſt be turned into hell, and all thoſe who forget God.</hi> And <hi>the Leaders of the people</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:199222:10"/> 
                  <hi>cauſe them to erre, and they that are led of them are deſtroyed,</hi> Iſa 9. 16. Is it not much better, more ſafe, and an act of faithfulneſs for parents to deal faithfully with their children, and let them know that they are not in the Covenant of grace, but that by nature they are children of wrath as well as others, that ſo they may through mercy come to the ſight of their natural condition, and their need of Chriſt; rather then to delude them with toyes and fancies, meer imaginations of the fleſhly mind vainly puffed up? Oh the Lord will make you know one day what it is thus to lift up your ſelves in fleſhly boaſting, and to make a noſe of wax of the Covenant of grace, turn it which way you pleaſe, in one day, and out another. 1. Believers children in; 2. All profeſſing Chriſt in, though never ſo wicked; 3. Baſtards in, all in, and all as ſoon and as well as any. (See <hi>pag.</hi> 5.) I muſt tell you, and that from the Lord, you will have a ſad account to give to the Lord one day, if mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy prevent not, for your abuſing the Covenant of grace, and thruſting a fleſhly generation upon the Lord, when he is ſeeking a ſpiritual, a holy ſeed to worſhip him: and I would have you to know, that thoſe you ſo often, and with ſo much contempt and reproach term <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,</hi> are not ſo <hi>ſimple</hi> as you would perſwade the world to believe; they are able through mercy to ſee into your forgeries and deluſions, and to diſcover them too in a meaſure; and to diſtinguiſh between Law and Goſpel, Covenant and Covenant, not confounding things together, <hi>ſo denying Chriſt to be come in the fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall in a word give you the difference. The Covenant of the Law, either that with <hi>Abraham</hi> or with <hi>Moſes,</hi> was a Covenant without them, and the myſterie or ſubſtance was hid from all (though all was in it) unleſs thoſe few taught of God: The Covenant of the Goſpel is wholly ſpiritual, and none are in it but the ſpiritual ſeed, <hi>viz.</hi> true believers; though hypocrites may come in to the outward profeſſion, yet they have nothing to do to be there, for there is no outſide in the Covenant of grace. That which you call the outward Covenant, is but the outward profeſſion of the inviſible grace, and that is proper only to thoſe who are in it: &amp; although the Diſciples did, and we may admit thoſe that may prove hypocrites; yet neither did they, nor may we admit any by baptiſm into the viſible profeſſion of the inviſible grace, but thoſe we judge by the rule of truth in this particular to have true faith; and if any come in that have it not, to their own peril it will be. Therefore if this be truth, as I am ſure it is, what account will thoſe give to the Lord, who bring in the natural ſeed to the profeſſion
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:199222:11"/> of the ſpiritual Covenant, and ſo make them hypocrites: A day will come, <hi>when the ſinners in Sion ſhall be afraid, and fearfulneſs ſhall ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe the hypocrite,</hi> Iſa. 33. So I conclude, that Infants are not in the Covenant of grace, nor were ever commanded to be baptized, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have no right unto it.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If this Argument were truth, it were a very eaſie thing to be a Chriſtian. Born Chriſtians by nature! no need of Chriſt, the Goſpel, Spirit, Regeneration, any thing; it makes void all the whole Goſpel of grace and peace; a doctrine of Devils indeed: Do you not remember that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>If any man preach any other Goſpel then what he had preached, he ſhould be accurſed,</hi> Gal. 1. But you have found out another Goſpel, Chriſtians by the natural generation and birth; Curſed be all ſuch ſoul deceiving, and ſoul deſtroying Doctrines. You pretend to prove your <hi>Minor</hi> with much clearneſs, <hi>As all the parings of Gold are Gold, ſo all the children of Chriſtians are Chriſtians:</hi> The parings of gold are true gold; and the children of Chriſtians by this account are true Chriſtians, pared out from the ſpiritual man, being of the ſame nature: oh high priviledge! Chriſtians can beget Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Saints can beget Saints by natural generation. Certainly if one of the preaching brethren had laid down ſuch an aſſertion, you would have counted him an illiterate <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> one altogether unmeet to have medled with the Scriptures, or to have ſpoken of the things of God: You would have accounted him no leſs then a blaſphemer, and worthy to be burnt with his Books. Well, but you proceed, <hi>As all the Children of the Jews were Jews by birth,</hi> Gal. 2. 15. <hi>And all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Turks are Turks by birth, ſo all the Children of Chriſtians are Chriſtians, and have a right to Baptiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Jews were all in an outward Covenant, and ſo they were born Jews, <hi>viz.</hi> in that Covenant; but believers are in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, as hath been already proved, and none are born in that Covenant by natural generation and birth: ſo that although Jews were Jews by birth, yet Chriſtians are not ſo by the natural birth, <hi>for that which is born of the Spirit, is spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:199222:11"/>
               <p>But ſecondly, the Jews were ſo by birth, as a diſtinguiſhing title from other Nations; ſo the Turks are Turks, and the Spaniards are Spaniards, and the French are French, and the Engliſh are Engliſh by birth, but they neither of them are Chriſtians by birth.</p>
               <p>But you ſeem to mend all in anſwering an Objection. <hi>Then we ſhould be born Chriſtians, and not made Chriſtians; we ſhould be born children of God, and not children of wrath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You anſwer: <hi>Parents cannot convey grace to their Children, but a right to Church priviledges, &amp;c.</hi> unheard of nonſence and confuſion, miſerable bald ſhifts men make to patch up their own inventions: 1. <hi>Chriſtians, yet no grace; a right to Church-priviledges, yet no grace; Members of the Church, yet no grace:</hi> page 23. <hi>Nay members of the Church, Chriſtians, a right to Church priviledges, holy, &amp;c. and yet have no grace, are the children of wrath, page</hi> 23. theſe are like to be goodly Chriſtians, Church Members, &amp;c. Yet you diſlike with the Anabaptiſts for not taking notice of this diſtinction, &amp;c.

A ſad thing, when you ſhall lead along ſouls blind with the name of Chriſtian, yet children of wrath, and if mercy prevent not, are like to periſh eternally, for all the name of Chriſtian: Thus are ſouls deluded by their Teachers, called Chriſtians, made Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and yet <hi>Children of wrath, &amp;c.

               <p>You pretend to prove it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. you ſay, <hi>Chriſt Commandeth his Diſciples, and in them all Miniſters ſucceſſively, to the end of the world, to go and baptize Nations;</hi> you ſay, <hi>Children are a part of the Nations, therefore they are commanded to be baptized:</hi> but there is, as you afterwards confeſs, a <hi>Diſcipling firſt, Diſciple Nations, baptizing them,</hi> and here is no command for Infant-baptiſm, but for the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Diſciples; you pretend to put off this <hi>with the dangerouſneſs of building Arguments on the bare placing of words in Scripture;</hi> you produce <hi>Repentance and</hi> Judas's <hi>ſop: Repentance ſometimes placed before Faith, yet we know it is a fruit of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, it is ſuch a fruit of faith as is individual; and upon a right underſtanding, Repentance may as well be ſaid to go before, as to follow after; for it is a change of the mind; and I querie whether any man did ever believe, or can believe before his mind is changed; its true, after believing the change is perfected more and more. But this is it which I affirm, That no man believes ſavingly without or before a change of the mind, which produceth a change of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation: As for the Sop, neither <hi>Matthew</hi> nor <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:199222:12"/> 
                  <hi>Judas</hi> received it before the Sacrament; <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith <hi>chap.</hi> 26. 23. <hi>He that dippeth with me in the diſh ſhall betray me;</hi> but he doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs when it was done, before or after; ſo <hi>Mark</hi> expreſſeth <hi>chap.</hi> 14. 20. <hi>That he that dippeth with him in the diſh ſhould betray him,</hi> but he doth not tell whether it was before or after; therefore what <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith is no contradiction, but rather a clearer explanation. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you ſay you will <hi>upon the account of placing words, eaſily prove Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to be before Preaching,</hi> Mark 1. 4. <hi>John did baptize in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and preach, &amp;c. Here Baptiſm is ſet before Preaching ſay you, &amp;c.</hi> but this is anſwered and explained by <hi>Matthew</hi> Chap. 3. 1, 2. <hi>John the Baptiſt preached in the Wilderneſs of Judea, ſaying, Repent, for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven is at hand,</hi> and ver. 5, 6. <hi>they were baptized of him in Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan:</hi> And this is according to the Analogie of Scripture, Preaching, Diſcipling, believing, confeſſing of ſins, repenting before baptizing; and produce if you can, that ever baptizing was ſet before believing, &amp;c. and not explained by another Scripture, as that of <hi>Mark</hi> explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Matthew:</hi> and then take heed, fear and tremble to change Scripture phraſes at your pleaſure, for your own ends, taking that firſt, which is and muſt be laſt. You may upon this very account turn out, and contradict all the moſt precious truth of God in Scripture; and this very thing ſtrikes at it; for the reaſon why Teaching, Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling and Faith is to precede baptiſm, is evident, that it is becauſe its Chriſts appointment, and there is a neceſſity that faith go before works; for there is no work acceptable before, or without faith; but <hi>Thomas Hall</hi> will have works go before faith, baptiſm before faith; though Chriſt hath ſaid the contrary, and ſo make void the Law of Chriſt, and the Faith of Jeſus, lay another foundation, works before faith, baptiſm before believing, and ſo teach men to ſin, <hi>For what-ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is not of faith is ſin: And he that breaketh one of the leaſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and teacheth men ſo to do, ſhall be called the leaſt in the Kingdom of heaven,</hi> Mat. 5. 19.

               <p>You ſay, <hi>There is a teaching after baptizing,</hi> Mat. 28. 20. <hi>A teaching before and after; and that baptizing is ſet in the middle, implying, that ſome muſt be taught before</hi> (viz.) <hi>Heathens; ſome after</hi> (viz.) <hi>Infants of believers.</hi> But you are much miſtaken in the ſecond; but it imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that there is a teaching before for the working of faith, and a tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching after for the building them up in the ſame faith: for that end God hath appointed Prophets, Paſtors, and Teachers in the Church; and thoſe Acts 2. 41. <hi>that were baptized,</hi> ver. 42. <hi>continued ſtedfaſt in the Apoſtles doctrine, &amp;c.</hi> So that this is the teaching before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter baptiſm there intended.</p>
               <p>You confeſs <hi>page</hi> 31. notwithſtanding your bold aſſertion in your Argument, <hi>That all your Command is but a conſequential command, and ſomething equivalent to a command, an implicite command, a neceſſary conſequence, &amp;c.</hi> I adviſe you to take heed, firſt how you lay down Arguments for the future in ſuch poſitive terms to delude the ſimple, yet confeſs at laſt it is but a neceſſary conſequence.</p>

               <p n="2"> 2. A little conſider how neceſſary the conſequence is; it is ſuch a conſequence as firſt makes void the command of Chriſt. 2.

I ſay, if this be permitted, to draw conſequences from Scripture to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturn commands, it is the moſt dangerous way that ever was invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to uſher in Hereſie and Errour; and upon that account its eaſie to turn out almoſt all the truth of God in Scripture, and ſet it at variance againſt it ſelf; we grant conſequences rightly grounded, but we deny conſequences to overturn Commands, and Goſpel, and all: As for all that you ſay from <hi>pag.</hi> 31. to 34. it is nothing but a reiteration of what hath been ſaid before, either in this, or your former Arguments. And notwithſtanding you are pleaſed to ſay pag. 33. <hi>That Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is clear enough to thoſe who have eyes to ſee, or hearts to believe it.</hi> To ſee and believe what you ſay, and take your word for all; for there is neither Scripture nor Reaſon for it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>By the way, Sir, Are you ſuch an enemy to literal Commands? will you make void literal commands, to ſet up your own inventions? or do you envy againſt them becauſe they overturn your practiſes?</p>
               <p>You ſay, <hi>They may do well to give you Commands for many of their practiſes: As firſt, what expreſs command they have to deny the Moral Law to be a rule of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They deny not the Moral Law to be a rule of life to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in its eſſence; but they deny it to be a rule of life as an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration in the hands of <hi>Moſes:</hi> But Chriſt having taken it into his own hands, and fulfilled the righteouſneſs of it, he gives it anew unto them, and it ceaſeth to be any more the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but is the Law of Chriſt; this is cleared abundantly, 1 Joh. 2. 7, 8. Firſt, <hi>It is no new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, but the old.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet ſecondly, <hi>It is a new Commandment, which is true in him, and in us, becauſe the darkneſs is paſt, and the true light now ſhineth.</hi> So that notwithſtanding it is the ſubſtance of the old, yet it is new, becauſe in Chriſt, and from him to us, and in us: If this will not ſatisfie, ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11. compared with 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 7, 8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You Querie, <hi>What expreſs command againſt the coercive power of</hi>

                  <hi>the Magiſtrate?</hi> I ſuppoſe you mean in the things of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſuppoſe if Magiſtrates command any thing contrary to the mind of Chriſt, we are not to obey; they have nothing to do to make uſe of their coercive power there; if they do, they ſin, and all men are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not to ſin. That it is a ſin, is clear; That which contradicts the command of God is ſin: <hi>Which ſhall we obey, God or man? judge ye,</hi> Acts 4 19. There was the command of God, and the command of man in oppoſition each to other, and there the command of man was ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Jeſus Chriſt is King of his Church, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 3. and its his work to make uſe of a coercive power, to bring in ſouls to his Kingdom, Pſal. 110. 4 <hi>In the day of his power his people ſhall be a willing people;</hi> and unleſs you can produce any Scripture, in which Chriſt hath reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his power to the Magiſtrate, I ſuppoſe he is ſtill King of his Church; and thoſe who make uſe of a coercive power in his Kingdom, are at beſt but Uſurpers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt hath entruſted and impowered none but his Miniſters with that work of gathering ſouls into his Kingdom; and this they are to do in his power, in his authority, and in his way: And thoſe who pretend themſelves to be the Miniſters of Chriſt, yet want the coercive power of the Magiſtrate, declare themſelves to be none of his, not ſerving the Lord Jeſus, but their own bellies, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is the ſubſtance of an expreſs command, <hi>Rom</hi> 14. 4. <hi>Who art thou that judgeſt another mans ſervant? to his own maſter he ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or falleth, &amp;c.</hi> And Jam. 4. 12. <hi>There is one Law giver, who is able to ſave and to deſtroy; who art thou that judgeſt another?</hi> Its clear, that none have power to judge and determine coercively, but he that hath a power to ſave and deſtroy: And the Reaſon is drawn from <hi>ver.</hi> 11. that none hath power to judge of the Law, and give ſentence, <hi>but he that is above the Law;</hi> and if any will go about to judge others by a coercive power, <hi>they are not doers of the Law, but Judges.</hi> This is meant only in Caſes of Conſcience, relating to Jeſus Chriſt; not but that Magiſtrates may, and ought to take cognizance of Civil things, and ſinfull actions flowing from the corruptions of men; but matters Spiritual and Divine, tending to Worſhip, there its the prerogative of God alone to judge.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You querie, <hi>What command we have to ſeparate from the Churches which hold the foundation pure?</hi> I anſwer, None at all that I know; neither do we ſeparate from any ſuch Churches, but from <hi>Babylon</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:199222:14"/> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> which hath been and is a <hi>cage of every unclean and hatefull birds;</hi> not true or pure either in its Conſtitutions, Members, Miniſtery, or Ordinances: and we have a Command for what we do. See and well conſider 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. from the firſt <hi>ver.</hi> to the fift, and <hi>Rev.</hi> 18 4.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You querie, <hi>What command we have for Rebaptizing?

Yet I ſhall ſee what you ſay to the buſineſs; for your <hi>Minor</hi> is denied: yet you are pleaſed to ſay, <hi>p.</hi> 36. in confirmation of your <hi>Minor,</hi> That the <hi>Minor</hi> flows from the Text; <hi>the Parents believing and repenting, he expreſly commands them to be baptized, both believers and their children.</hi> Oh unheard of falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood! is there ever ſuch a word in the Text, as, <hi>and their Children?</hi> He ſaith, <hi>Repent and be baptized every one of you;</hi> that is, every one of you <hi>that are pricked in your hearts.</hi> You adde, <hi>and their Children.</hi> It ſeems you have either forgotten, or elſe you fear not that curſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt him that <hi>addeth to, or diminiſheth from the words of this Book.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon you render, is, <hi>Becauſe the promiſe is to you and to your children Is, not was, and is now vaniſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> That Promiſe you ſo much plead for, which is but one and the ſame you have ſo often reiterated already, is vaniſhed away, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:199222:15"/> the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are out of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> &amp;c. and we are under another, a better Covenant, a new Covenant, &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 31. <hi>Heb</hi> 8. <hi>eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes.</hi> That promiſe was the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> ours is the true promiſe of the Spiritual Land: they had the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> promiſed, and it was made good while they kept Covenant with God; we have the Spiritual Land promiſed, and that is made good to all the Spiritual ſeed. And this is the promiſe here intended, and it is limited to all <hi>that the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi> 1. The promiſe here related, is intended only to called ones; and it is a reſtriction to all the ſeveral terms before. As many <hi>of you as the Lord ſhall call. Of your children, as the Lord ſhall call. Of them afar off,</hi> viz. <hi>Gentiles, as the Lord ſhall call.</hi> For the truth is, that there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in the Goſpel but to called ones. See this cleer, <hi>Joel.</hi> 2. 32. the Scripture to which this in the <hi>Acts</hi> relates. <hi>In mount Sion and in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem ſhall be deliverance, as the Lord hath ſaid, and in the remnant whom the Lord ſhell call.</hi> Its the very ſame with <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 39. and note, 1. The Call is not, as you plead, <hi>univerſal,</hi> but <hi>to a remnant;</hi> and thoſe who are thus called, ſhall be <hi>delivered, ſaved.</hi> This daſhes to peeces your aſſertions throughout your Argument: they are the called ones, and they only to whom the promiſe belongs; for the promiſes are all centered in Chriſt, and given forth to the called ones; not thoſe who are outwardly called, but effectually and ſavingly called. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>a Mediator of a better Teſtament;</hi> but you will have the ſame; ſo deny Chriſt to be come in the fleſh. <hi>That by means of death for the redemption of the tranſgreſſions under the firſt Teſtament,</hi> Chriſt died to deliver his people from the tranſgreſſions under the firſt <hi>Covenant,</hi> that ſo <hi>they which are called might receive the promiſe of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal inheritance.</hi> Here is the promiſe, the <hi>eternal inheritance;</hi> the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom, <hi>they that are called,</hi> not infants the natural ſeed, but the ſpiritual: the ſame mentioned <hi>Rom</hi> 8. 30. <hi>Whom he predeſtinated, them he called,</hi> &amp;c. and to them, and them only the promiſe belongs.</p>
               <p>This I doubt not but it will be enough to the judicious Reader to diſcover the vanity and emptineſs of all you ſay to this ſixth argument. For children are not taken literally any otherwiſe then as called of the Lord. For the <hi>Jews</hi> crucifying <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and wiſhing his blood to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them and their children; the <hi>Gentiles</hi> having a hand in it too, they <hi>mocked him,</hi> &amp;c. they being <hi>pricked in their hearts at</hi> Peters <hi>Sermon,</hi> the Apoſtle applieth a ſuitable medicine to their wounded conſciences: he doth not tell them of an outward promiſe, a Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> an
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:199222:15"/> outward federal holineſs for themſelves &amp; children, which they might have, and yet be damned at laſt; No, no, but a ſpiritual promiſe that might reach their ſouls in ſuch a condition: therefore in ſubſtance he ſaith, Notwithſtanding you have had a hand in crucifying the Lord Jeſus, the promiſe of the ſpirit of grace and of remiſſion <hi>is to you, as many of you as the Lord ſhall call;</hi> and notwithſtanding you have by your deprecations drawn guilt upon your children, yet the <hi>promiſe is to them, as many of them as the Lord ſhall call:</hi> and notwithſtanding the <hi>Gentiles</hi> have joyned with you in it, yet the <hi>promiſe is to them, to as many as the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi> And this is the ſenſe and truth of this Scripture: and I do affirm that there is no Goſpel-promiſe made to any but the <hi>called of God;</hi> and all others that get into the Goſpel-profeſſion, not being of the true ſpiritual ſeed, God will judge them in his time. And it is evident there were none baptized, but thoſe that gladly received his word, <hi>v.</hi> 41.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, 1. If it had been done, yet not being written, ſilent au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority proves nothing. All you can ſay, is but that it <hi>might be done,</hi> not that it was done; becauſe it is not written.</p>

But I paſs it by; a word to the wiſe is enough. But I ſhall rather come to diſcover the grounds of your Probabilities from thoſe families.</p>
               <p>The firſt is in <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 47, 48. <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his houſhold, they were firſt <hi>ſuch as heard the word;</hi> therefore not Infants. <hi>v.</hi> 33. <hi>Now therefore are we all here preſent before God to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</hi> Secondly, <hi>v.</hi> 44. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt fell on all them that heard the word.</hi> Thirdly, they were thoſe, and only thoſe that were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, which heard the word, and had received the holy Spirit. <hi>ver.</hi> 47. <hi>Can any forbid water, that theſe ſhould not be baptized which have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the holy Spirit as well as we? And he commanded them,</hi> viz that had heard, and received the Spirit as well as they, <hi>to be baptized.</hi> Where are your <hi>Infants</hi> now? and where is your <hi>probability</hi> for your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe? Blame me not if I undermine you; for I am a <hi>Collier,</hi> and muſt dig up the blackneſs, that truth may appear.</p>
               <p>The ſecond family is <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 15. <hi>Lydia and her family;</hi> there might be <hi>Infants,</hi> ſay you. Querie 1. whether <hi>Lydia</hi> was a maid, widow or wife? <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is generally concluded on all hands, that ſhe had no husband; for if ſhe had, he had been mentioned; for alwayes the man bears the denomination, where there is any, and not the woman. If it be objected, he might not be baptized, therefore not mentioned: I anſwer, the houſhold were baptized, therefore the husband, if any; and he muſt have born the name, being the chief. So its cleer, there was no husband; then where is your probability for Children? Secondly, the houſhold of <hi>Lydia</hi> were brethren capable of comfort, therefore not Infants, <hi>v.</hi> 39.</p>
               <p>The third family mentioned is the Jailors, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 31, 32, 33. You ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 43. <hi>That he believed, and preſented his houſhold upon his faith, and they were baptized.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Conſider a little better of this Scripture. 1. The Jailors houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:199222:16"/> were ſuch as were all capable of hearing the word. <hi>v.</hi> 32. <hi>And they ſpake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his houſe.</hi> 2. They were ſuch as with him rejoyced, believing in God. <hi>v.</hi> 34. <hi>And when he had brought them into his houſe, he ſet meat before them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced, believing in God with all his houſe.</hi> So that they firſt hear, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly believe, thirdly are baptized. Where is your probability for Children now?</p>
               <p>The fourth houſhold is <hi>Crispus,</hi> Act. 18. 8. The text is clear, <hi>He believed in God with all his houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth is <hi>Stephanus,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 16. This houſhold was ſuch as were <hi>addicted to the miniſtry of the Saints,</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 15. therefore not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants. But it ſeems you do not like to have theſe two Scriptures joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, becauſe the one ſo cleerly explains the other. 2. You ſay, <hi>that thoſe that were of years might miniſter, when Infants were only baptized.</hi> I wonder what you mind by <hi>only:</hi> were the Infants only baptized, and thoſe that did miniſter to the Saints not baptized? That ſeems to be the probability, and as like as the other. But the text ſaith, <hi>Ye know the houſhold of Stephanus,</hi> viz. the ſame houſhold as was baptized. You will diſtinguiſh for your own end; when he ſaith, <hi>the houſhold,</hi> that is, ſay you, <hi>thoſe that were of years.</hi> But you will permit no ſuch diſtinction to us, were not the Scriptures through mercy made cleer; but it muſt be all the houſhold, not the major part for the whole. Yet here you can preſently divide or diſtinguiſh for your own ends, when there is no place for a diſtinction. Theſe things thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, let the Reader judge impartially the weight of your proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility for precept, promiſe, or preſident, as you have ſumm'd it up in the concluſion of this Argument.</p>

               <p>You ſay, <hi>The ſeal of the Covenant is a choiſe priviledge.</hi> I have often ſaid, and ſay again, that Baptiſm is no ſeal of the Covenant, but the Spirit.</p>
               <p>To your ſecond Argument I ſay, there is no truth in your <hi>Major;</hi> for there is not a word of Baptizing in the Text; and therefore no ground to receive them to Baptiſm, though Chriſt received them and <hi>bleſſed them.</hi> I ſhall anſwer the Scripture more at large by and by.</p>
               <p>As to the third, <hi>Thoſe that Chriſt invites, the Church may not refuſe.</hi> Where doth Chriſt invite Infants? Thoſe Infants are gone long ſince. He ſaith, <hi>Suffer the Infants,</hi> not all Infants. 2. The Church are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thoſe Chriſt hath given rule and command to receive, <hi>viz. Believers.</hi> Chriſt may receive ſome Infants, becauſe he knows them: The Church doth not know them, therefore the Church may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You ſay, <hi>They that are capable of the Kingdom and Bleſſing, which is the greater, are much more capable of Baptiſm, which is the leſſer. But Infants are capable of the greater.</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Some Infants by vertue of Election may be capable of the greater, yet not capable of the leſſer. 1. Becauſe not capable to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the leſſer. 2. Becauſe we are not capable to underſtand and know them. 3. Becauſe there is no command for it; for that is it we are to walk by, and that capacity in which we are to judge.</p>
               <p n="5">5. You ſay, <hi>If the Kingdom of heaven receive them, the Church may not exclude them.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Kingdom of heaven, of glory, receives none but the elect of God: the Church doth not know them; therefore the Church cannot receive them, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now to your Scripture, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. 14. <hi>Suffer the little Children, and forbid them not.</hi> Note, he ſaith not, ſuffer little children, but ſuffer the little children; not all little children, but <hi>the little ones,</hi> that is, thoſe that were then brought unto him. You draw a Concluſion from hence to have all, <hi>p.</hi> 3, 4, 5. It's evident in that, that he would have them to come to him, that ſo he might take an occaſion to diſcover a Goſpel-myſterie, viz. <hi>That of ſuch is the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> that is, ſo qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified ſpiritually, as they were naturally, meek, humble, teachable, helpleſs, &amp;c. This is cleer, compared with <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, whoſoever doth not receive the kingdom of heaven as a little child, he ſhall not enter therein;</hi> that is, as I ſaid before, ſo qualified ſpiritually, as little children are naturally. Hence 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>As new born babes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the ſincere milk of the word, &amp;c.</hi> that is, not as new-born babes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the ſincere milk of the word; but as new born babes deſire the milk of the breaſt, ſo do you deſire the milk of the word. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 2, 3, 4. cleers the whole. <hi>Except a man be converted, and become as a little child, he cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven.</hi> So that the ſubſtance of the whole in every Scripture mentioned by you to this purpoſe, directly preſents us with the ſame truth, <hi>viz.</hi> the humble child like qualifications of his ſervants; and not to fill up the Church with Infants contrary to Chriſts command, and the practiſe of all his ſervants, which is to be our alone rule and preſident.</p>
               <p>In a word, the Scriptures produced for proof of your Arguments, have not a word of baptiſm in them, nor the leaſt hint that way; and for you to draw conſequences from ſuch grounds, eſpecially thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences overturning precepts and preſidents, is very dangerous and unſafe, and that which we are bound in duty and conſcience to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce.</p>
               <p>Chriſt knew what he had to do, and hath left us a rule for what we ſhould do; he that forſakes this rule, and will not hear Chriſt, <hi>is to be cut off from amongst his people,</hi> Acts 3. 22, 23. They that will draw concluſions into practiſe from what Chriſt did, contradicting what he hath commanded, will be found enemies not permitting Chriſt to reign over them; and what the danger will be of ſuch concluſions, ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 27.</p>
               <p>The ſumme of all is this, that although Chriſt knows the Elect In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:199222:21"/> and receives them, yet we do not know them; it's Gods ſecret, and we are to walk by revealed rules, and are to receive none before the manifeſtation of faith, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 37. and it's evident the Church did receive none but ſuch, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 41, 42.

               <p>If it appear that there is no truth in this aſſertion, then your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fals to the ground: But there is no truth in this aſſertion. <hi>Ergo.</hi> I ſhall make it appear, 1.

For when Chriſt the true ſpiritual ſeed was come, the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſeed and memberſhip was broken off, and only that of ſaith was graffed in: That as the natural ſeed ſtood members upon the account of the firſt Covenant and promiſe made with <hi>Abraham;</hi> ſo the ſpiritual ſeed, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſeed of faith, Chriſt being come, and is the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:199222:22"/> ſubſtance of that Covenant, they are ingraffed into that root; he being holy, they are alſo holy, according to the words of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 1, 2.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural parents, or Chriſt the true root? Is not he the foundation upon which they are built, and the true root and ſtock into which they are ingrafted; and bears them up, and makes fruitful?</p>
               <p>Whereas you ſay, <hi>That by ingraffing in, is meant admiſſion into vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible communion.</hi> I ſay, it is not only that; but firſt faith, and then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into viſible communion. And one word by the way; what viſible communion are Infants capable of, if they may ſome of them be capable of inviſible union and communion with Jeſus Chriſt; yet where is their capacity of viſible communion with the Church, which conſiſts in communicating of experiences; in Ordinances, <hi>fellowſhip in breaking bread, and prayers?</hi> where is your viſible communion of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, Sir?</p>
               <p>You ſeem to anſwer an objection, <hi>p.</hi> 63. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of an inviſible Church.

Thoſe that are graffed in truly, ſhall ſtand and thrive, the root Chriſt bears them; They that are but in ſhew ſhall fall, the root will not bear them, becauſe not graffed in by the heavenly Father.

               <p>Your <hi>Major</hi> hath been often denied, for its but the ſubſtance of what you have often ſaid before; and therefore in ſubſtance I muſt anſwer what I have anſwered before; there is no ſuch thing mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all the New-Teſtament as a federal holineſs, <hi>viz.</hi> an external Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-holineſs without an internal, this being the ſubſtance of what you ſay <hi>pag.</hi> 65. you confeſs children only by nature, <hi>that there is no difference between the childe of a Chriſtian and the childe of an Infidel:</hi> Yet conſider him as believing, ſo he and his are holy; he is holy ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, but are his Infants ſo too? no; you confeſs pag. 62. <hi>This cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be remembred, that the holineſs you ſpeak of is not perſonal inherent holineſs; for this cannot be tranſmitted to poſterity; but tis a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral, external Covenant-holineſs.</hi> Pray Sir the next time let me know where in the New Teſtament this ſame external holineſs, without the internal, is ſo much ſpoken of or commended: The Lord loveth truth in the inward parts, and condemns hypocriſie and hypocrites; he condemns the form without the power; he owns no <hi>Jew but the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, no ſeed but the ſpiritual: the axe is now laid to the root of the Tree; every Tree that bringeth not forth good fruit muſt be cut down,</hi> Mat. 3. and yet you are all for an outward holineſs without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which is indeed and truth an abomination unto the Lord. But to come to the Scripture you pretend to ground your Argument from: You ſay, <hi>The Anabaptiſts have invented an evaſion to avoid the force of the Text: that ſay they, its a matrimonial holineſs, that they are legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate and no baſtards, &amp;c.</hi> Which I affirm, is the truth of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and ſhall 1. give ſome brief anſwers to what you aſſert.

Anſw.</hi> and why not upon a Matrimonial account, more
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:199222:23"/> holy, that is, more lawfull then thoſe born of fornication? And whereas you ſay, <hi>they are dogs that are without,</hi> &amp;c. It is true, that is, comparatively to the true Church and Spiritual Seed; ſo are not only Turks and Pagans, but moſt of your Church-members, who do the ſame, if not worſe works then they; only you have perſwaded them into an outward Covenant as you and they imagine; but that helps not the buſineſs. 2. Its ſin to wicked men what ever they do; yet their civil actions are better to them, as eating, drinking, plowing, Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, lawfull procreation of children, then the contrary evil actions; the Apoſtle ſaith that marriage is honourable among all. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 4. If among all, then among Turks, and their children are civilly holy, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully begotten according to a civil inſtitution; though nothing be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſpiritually holy, but to thoſe in Chriſt, its a Law God hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the hearts both of Turks and Indians, that they are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious in defiling of the Marriage eſtate, then many of thoſe you call Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You ſay, <hi>The Apoſtles reaſon would have no weight with it; for their children were legitimate before converſion, ſo he ſhould allow them no more priviledge then meer Infidels have, &amp;c.</hi> The Query is not, what they were before converſion, but one being converted, and the other not; the doubt ariſeth, whether or no, the Believer muſt put away the unbeliever: if he or ſhe muſt do ſo, then the children muſt be gone too, both before and after converſion, and this was a Priviledge to the Believer, not to be compelled to part with his children: though unbelievers had the ſame in being, yet it was not to them ſuch a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, for mercy is mercy to a Believer indeed; he ſees every thing ſanctified to him, which the unbeliever doth not.</p>

               <p n="3">3. It can be no other ſanctification then that of the unbeliever, and that is granted by <hi>Tho: Hall,</hi> to be but a Marriage-Sanctification, and the childes holineſs can be no other, for it flows from it; <hi>the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer is ſanctified, elſe were your children unclean, but now are they holy.</hi> He doth not ſay, the Believer is ſanctified, elſe they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, and that muſt have been the words to have made any thing for your federal holineſs; <hi>but the unbeliever is ſanctified, &amp;c.</hi> It being thus cleared, that the holineſs of the childe flows from the Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the unbeliever, then its the ſame with the unbeliever; but it flows from it, therefore one with it; and this is concluded, that a

               <q>5. You ſay, <hi>Then they are the Devils children.</hi>

               <q>8. You ſay, <hi>This robs Infants of their right, Parents of their comfort, the Church of her members, Chriſt of his merits, and God of his glory.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I tell you, there is a great cry, and but little wooll, when looked after. 1. <hi>Children of their rights.</hi> When Chriſt in the Goſpel hath nowhere given them that right. Secondly, when they have it given them, it is ſuch a right as deludes them, there is nothing in it, but words and wind. 2. <hi>Parents of their comfort.</hi> What comfort is it to parents who underſtand, and are not as ignorant as their babes, to have their children cheated, ſealed with a blank or a counterfeit that can do them no good? 3. <hi>The Church of its members.</hi> Alas, of what uſe are ſuch members in the Church of Chriſt? Did you ever find ſuch members there? There are, or ſhould be none but uſeful members. 4. <hi>Chriſt of his merits.</hi> Did Chriſt merit baptiſm for Infants? if ſo, you ſhould have proved it. Or purchaſe his Church? <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25. 5. <hi>And God of his glory.</hi> What glory would Infants bring to God in the Church of Chriſt? Can they worſhip ſpiritually? Such <hi>he ſeeks to worſhip him,</hi> Joh. 4. 24. can they <hi>offer up ſpiritual ſacrifice, acceptable, &amp;c?</hi> This is the work of the Church of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2 5. and they that cannot do this, diſhonour God in his Church, and have nothing to do to be there. Theſe things thus conſidered, I leave the Reader to judge who diſhonor God moſt, thoſe who contrary to his revealed will thruſt upon him of their own heads a company of ignorant dead members, that do not know him, and cannot worſhip; or thoſe who according to his revealed will endeavour to keep the Church pure, and admit none but thoſe they judge living members, knowing that none elſe can offer to him living ſacrifice, acceptable, &amp;c.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſon why I record this in this place, is firſt to preſent to view the probability of <hi>Higinus</hi> bringing in of Infants Baptiſm; for you ſay, that you finde by <hi>Platina,</hi> that he brought in Godfathers firſt; and I finde by <hi>Joannes Boemus,</hi> that he that brought Godfathers firſt, brought in Infants-Baptiſm with it</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I finde that there was a time when there was a Canonical Sanction or Statute againſt it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The coming in of Infant-Baptiſm, with the reaſon of it, <hi>viz.</hi> leſt any ſhould die without it, and the manner of it with God-fathers; and dipping not ſprinkling in the holy Font.</p>
                  <p>And this Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> confeſſeth himſelf, in his third Edition of the <hi>Saints Everlaſting Reſt,</hi> part. 1. ch. 8. Sect 5 p, 179. in the Margin he ſaith, And in the Primitive times none were Baptized without an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Covenanting, wherein they renounced the world, fleſh, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and engaged themſelves to Chriſt, and promiſed to obey him, as you may ſee in <hi>Tertul. Origen, Cyprian,</hi> and others at large, &amp;c. This being a Truth, where is ground for Infant-Baptiſm, upon Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> own confeſſion? So that theſe things thus conſidered, takes off all your probabilities, that <hi>the Apoſtles did baptize Infants, and that it hath been a practiſe in the Church ever ſince; yet you confeſs immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly, that ſome of the ancients,</hi> pag. 89. <hi>did perſwade men from bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Infants; yet ſay you, their diſſwaſions ſhew that their uſual pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice was to baptize them.</hi> I ſay, that it rather did ſhew that thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients knew that it was but an invention of man, and that there was no ground for it in Scripture; elſe what need they to diſſwade them from it?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You ſay, S. <hi>John died</hi> 104. ſaith <hi>Alſteed;</hi> a likely or unlikely
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:199222:29"/> matter; the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith long before, a mans days were threeſcore and ten, &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> died a 104 years after Chriſt; if this be likely, I leave all to judge. <hi>Juſtin Martyr, you ſay, who lived in all probability;</hi> It is but probability then, and very unlikely; for you ſay <hi>he flouriſhed about</hi> 130. is this like to be in <hi>Johns</hi> days? all <hi>John</hi> days might be, nay muſt be, well near 200 years then; and all this you ſtrain to draw down, if you could, Baptiſm of Infants from the Apoſtles; the ſum of all is this, <hi>Juſtin Martyr diſputes the difference between Infants who die baptized, and thoſe who die unbaptized; he lived probably in S.</hi> Johns <hi>days, and knew the practiſe of the Apoſtle; but he lived</hi> 130 <hi>years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt; John muſt live ſo long too, or</hi> 104 <hi>at leaſt, that ſo</hi> Juſtin Martyr <hi>might know Apoſtolick practiſe from</hi> John: You mention others, as <hi>Tertullian, Origen Cyprian, &amp;c.</hi> who mention baptizing of Infants; it may be they mention it as an Innovation: for Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſaith expreſly, as before, that they ſay there were none baptized in the Primitive times without an expreſs Covenanting, &amp;c.

                     <hi>hath four ſeverall ſignifications:</hi> 1. <hi>To drownd, plunge or overwhelm,</hi> 2. <hi>To dye or dip.</hi> 3. <hi>To moyſten or make wet.</hi> 4. <hi>To waſh or cleanſe.</hi> Note 1. It doth not by your own confeſſion ſignifie to ſprinkle: you have ſaid enough to ſatisfie any that deſireth ſatisfaction in this particular, that your Practiſe of ſprinkling, is not according to the Scripture; and in truth, ſprinkling is another word, and another thing then Baptizing; <hi>Rantizo</hi> is the Greek word for ſprinkling, and <hi>Baptizo</hi> from <hi>Bapto</hi> is the Greek word for Baptizing: take it in which of theſe four you pleaſe; neither of them is to ſprinkle; but in dipping, either of all the four is fulfilled; if dipped, then wet, then waſhed, then drowned or plunged; ſo that dipping is nothing ſhort of Baptizing, for the word ſignifieth it; its nothing beyond Baptiſm; for it is but a plunging, a wetting, or waſhing of the whole man: ſo that take in all the ſignifications of that word <hi>Baptizo,</hi> dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping anſwers them all; but ſprinkling anſwers neither; and in deed and truth, is not baptizing, but another thing, and that which <hi>Chriſt</hi> never commanded. Sprinkling a little water in the face is not a dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping or plunging, it is not a wetting or waſhing the whole man, and in no caſe anſwers the command of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But for the clearing of this particular, I ſhall give theſe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:199222:30"/> four grounds, to confirm dipping to be the true baptizing, and not ſprinkling.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the ſignification of the word, as hath been already minded, it is the concluſion of all the Maſters of the Greek Tongue, in the Greek Lexicons, that the firſt, and moſt native, and proper ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Baptizo</hi> is to dip or plunge into, or under water: and this your ſelf confeſſe, that 1. It ſignifieth to drown, plunge, overwhelm, die or dip; this Mr. <hi>Lee</hi> in his <hi>Critica Sacra</hi> on the word, and <hi>Paſſor,</hi> with divers others affirms, whom I ſuppoſe you conclude were Maſters of the Greek Tongue; and this likewiſe Doctor <hi>Featly</hi> in his <hi>Dipper Dipt</hi> confeſſeth; and this I finde, that the word <hi>Baptizo</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver rendred in the New-Teſtament to ſprinkle, nor <hi>Rantizo</hi> to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize; therefore do no longer wreſt the truth contrary to your own knowledge, but be ſtill, and know that God is God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the Practiſe of the Servants of the Lord in the Primitive times, who beſt knew the minde of Chriſt: 1. <hi>John</hi> who was the <hi>Meſſenger of Chriſt,</hi> Mal. 3. 1. <hi>Baptized; and he baptized in</hi> Jordan, Mat. 3 6. <hi>And he baptized Chriſt himſelf in</hi> Jordan, ver. 16. with Mark 1. 9. <hi>and he came up out of the water.</hi> What need <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>John</hi> go down into the water, if ſprinkling would do the deed? And the Text ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>That Jeſus cometh to John to be baptized,</hi> that is, upon Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> one account, to be plunged, dipped, wet, or waſhed, not ſprinkled, and being dip'd he was both wet and waſhed. And <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 23. its ſaid, <hi>That John was baptizing</hi> (not ſprinkling) <hi>in Enon neer Salim, becauſe there was much water there;</hi> If ſprinkling had been the thing required, no need of much water. To this, you ſay, 1. <hi>Water was ſcarce in thoſe hot Countries; that infers not a ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping naked, and plunging of all that were Baptized, but only the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of baptizing a multitude, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Do you know, or have you heard of any ſuch hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where there could not be water had enough to ſprinkle many thouſands, if need require? 2. Was <hi>Canaan</hi> ſuch a Country as that water was ſcarce in it, being the promiſed fruitfull Land in the whole world, a type of the <hi>Heavenly Canaan?</hi> where were <hi>Wells digged, Deut.</hi> 6. 11. <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 25. and <hi>Rivers in abundance,</hi> or elſe the Type holds not correſpondence to the Antitype, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 13 <hi>Iſ.</hi> 12. 3. Therefore for ſhame talk no more of a dry and hot Country; it being a Land of Rivers and Wells digged, &amp;c. So that if a little water would have done it, as a little would have ſprinkled thouſands, they needed not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:199222:30"/> to have been baptized in <hi>Enon;</hi> ſo the word is not <hi>at,</hi> but in <hi>Enon;</hi> and ſo theſe ſeveral places tranſlated <hi>with water, Mat.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 8. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 26. <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 5. in the Greek it is rendred in every one of them <hi>in water;</hi> although you ſeem to hold forth that <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                     </gap> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſignifieth <hi>with;</hi> yet the proper ſignification of <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is <hi>in,</hi> and is ſo underſtood and rendred twenty times in the New Teſtament againſt once <hi>with;</hi> that being the proper ſignification of the word, and moſt ſutable to the Practiſe of the Apoſtles and ſervants of the Lord. Compare the former Scriptures with <hi>Act</hi> 8. 38. and its clear they bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in the water, not becauſe of the ſcarcity of water as you pretend, but becauſe there was much water, without which that Ordinance of dipping could not be adminiſtred. As for your Font-ſprinkling there is not the leaſt ſhadow of any ground for it in the Scripture; and whereas you ſay, <hi>not a ſtripping naked, &amp;c.</hi> the Scripture mentions no ſuch thing, neither is it our Practiſe, nor yours neither. Do you uſe to ſtrip naked when you ſprinkle? neither do we when we baptize, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You ſay, <hi>Suppoſe the Apoſtles did dip thoſe whom they baptized, yet 'twill not follow therefore that we muſt do ſo too, becauſe tis only an example without a precept, and ſo doth not binde us, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There was the precept both to them and us. 2. they knew the will of him who gave the precept, and walked according to it, and we by their preſident know what the precept was, and ſo its a precept to us as well as them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They lived in Judea in hot climates where was no danger of dipping &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. And was there one way for them in <hi>Judea,</hi> and another for us in <hi>England?</hi> prove that by Scripture when you write next.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Was their Country ſo much hotter then ours? had they not Winter and Summer, heat and cold, froſt and ſnow, as we have? <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 22. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74. 17. <hi>Ier.</hi> 36. 22. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. 8. Therefore give off this for ſhame likewiſe. Say no more their Country was hot, and ours cold. You ſay, <hi>The danger of dipping in our cold Country, is, that many in our dayes have dyed.</hi> If you intend the dipping of Believers, you ſpeak a horrid untruth: I am confident that never one periſhed in that way. But ſecondly, if you minde dipping of Infants, I know none are dipped. 2. If any be, no wonder if they periſh, being done out of Gods way having no warrant from him.</p>
                  <p>You confeſs Mr. <hi>Perkins approves of dipping in hot Countries, and in men of years, but denies the uſe of it to Infants, becauſe of their health.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, is not this Country hot enough to Dip? they had winter
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:199222:31"/> who dipped, as well as we; but no wonder if it be dangerous to the health of Infants; let it be adminiſtred to the right Subjects, <hi>viz.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and you need not doubt of dipping. Whereas you queſtion it <hi>for ſick and old folks,</hi> pag. 115. I ſay there is no ſuch neceſſity to Baptize ſuch in Winter, <hi>God will have mercy and not ſacrifice:</hi> let them ſtay till Summer; but take heed, change not the Ordinance from Dipping to Sprinkling; that is a dangerous thing. But you confeſs <hi>pag.</hi> 114. <hi>That dipping is a lawfull manner of Baptizing;</hi> in this you have confuted all you have ſaid to this particular either before or after: For if dipping be a lawfull manner of Baptizing, then firſt ſprinkling is unlawfull, for there is but one lawfull way of baptizing; the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture I am ſure mentions no more, there is but one Baptiſm. 2. Then our dipping is lawfull. 3. You have done ill ſervice in all you have ſaid to render a practiſe ſo contemptible, which is as you confeſs in it ſelf lawfull.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You ſay, <hi>The Scripture cals ſprinkling baptizing.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In Circumciſion a little skin in one part only was cut off.</hi>

Which ſhall be my 3. ground, that dipping, and not ſprinkling is the true Baptiſm.</p>

I ſhall give you the Judgment of one approved and learned, Mr. <hi>Tho. Goodwin,</hi> in his <hi>Support of faith from Chriſts reſurrection,</hi> ch. 7. p. 54. He ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4. <hi>We are ſaid to be</hi> buried with him in baptiſm, <hi>&amp; Col.</hi> 2. 12. Buried with him in baptiſm. <hi>It is not ſimply ſaid, Like as he was buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp;c. but, Buried with him. So our communion and oneneſs with him in his reſurrection is repreſented to us therein, and not only our conformity or likeneſs unto him therein. And ſo Baptiſm repreſenteth this to us; that Chriſt having once in himſelf ſuſtained the perſons of all the elect in his burial and reſurrection; that now upon the party himſelf is perſonally, particularly, and apparently reacted the ſame part again in his baptiſm; thereby ſhewing what his communion with Chriſt before was, in what was done to Chriſt; that he then was buried with Chriſt, and roſe with him, and upon that ground is now in this outward ſign of Baptiſm, as in a ſhew or repreſentation, both buried, and alſo riſeth again.</hi> Thus far <hi>Tho. Goodwin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You ſay, <hi>If dipping be true baptizing,</hi> (which you have already granted, that dipping is lawfull baptizing; yet here you put an <hi>if</hi> to it, as if you had forgotten what you had ſaid before: but it's no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for it is uſual with you) <hi>then ſome that have been dipt by Popiſh Prieſts, have been rightly baptized.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> We deny it: for though you have loſt the right way of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, as well as the ſubject, yet we do not ſay that thoſe Infants that are dipt are rightly baptized; becauſe you fail in the right ſubject, <hi>viz.</hi> Believers. Only we cannot but take notice of the juſt hand of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:199222:32"/> God in it againſt you; that having tranſgreſſed in taking Infants in ſtead of Believers, you ſhould change the very thing, and do another thing in ſtead of baptiſm, <hi>viz,</hi> ſprinkle; that ſo you might have the leſs to ſay in your own cauſe. Thus have you fulfilled that word, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24. 5. <hi>Tranſgreſſed the Law, changed the Ordinances, broken the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant,</hi> applying it to the natural ſeed, when it belongs to none but the ſpiritual. How you will avoid that curſe, I know not.</p>
                  <p>You ſay, <hi>It is the cuſtome and practiſe of all Reformed Churches to baptize by ſprinkling,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> What of that, if it contradict Scripture, which is the rule of Saints? You have confeſſed that dipping is a lawful baptizing; and there is but one lawful baptizing; therefore we muſt do that which is lawfull, though all people in the world do contrary.</p>
                  <p>The 4. ground why ſprinkling is not baptizing, is from the cuſtom retained from the Primitive times, as it is probable. And give me leave in this to conclude thus much; that I may much ſafer conclude this, it being ſo agreeable with the analogie of Scripture, then you can take up the whole practiſe upon that account. I ſay, Dipping in all Ages hath been the practiſe, (whether Believers or Infants.) The Hiſtory I mentioned before of <hi>Joannes Boemus,</hi> in the Manners and Cuſtoms of all Nations, <hi>p.</hi> 159. <hi>Infants were dipped in the holy Font.</hi> In <hi>Simpſons</hi> Hiſtory of the Church, in the fourth Councel of <hi>Toledo,</hi> it was ordered that there ſhould be but one dipping in baptiſm, <hi>p.</hi> 527. <hi>An</hi> 639. And the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> from whence you came, retains by tradition Dipping: and Sprinkling is an innovation not of many years ſtanding in this Nation, as is well known; <hi>Auſtin</hi> when he came firſt into <hi>England,</hi> baptized in Rivers; in particular (as Hiſtory relates) he baptized ſome thouſands in a River neer <hi>York.</hi>

            <p>YOu are pleaſed to write a <hi>Word</hi> to <hi>Thomas Collier,</hi> &amp;c. A Love-letter; he that runs may read it. And indeed we did conclude before what we might expect from you, if the Lord gave you power according to your will. And I make no queſtion but what you have here written, will make the Magiſtrate the more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of what ſpirit you are, and will keep from you what you ſo much expect, <hi>viz.</hi> a Coercive power to compell or perſecute all that are contrary to you. And in what you have done, I believe you have more wounded your ſelf and your own intereſt, then either the truth or me; the Truth ſtanding pure in it ſelf, getting advantage by its enemies, though no thanks to them. And as for my ſelf, a poor weak and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Creature, held forth in the hand of the Lord, and being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by Divine aſſiſtance, ſhall, I doubt not, but with joy paſs through good report and bad reportt, till I have finiſhed my courſe, and done the work whereunto I am appointed; accounting the reproach of Chriſt greater riches then the treaſures of <hi>Egypt,</hi> viz.

            <p>You ſay, <hi>I Colly every thing; Trinity, Scripture, Law, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Sir, you are miſtaken in it all, and ſo indeed have written forged falſhood, and ſent it abroad into the world. But I own and honour all theſe you mention, in their proper place, and according to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the Lord: and your ſelf it is who have been in the Black ſo long, that you Colly all, as will appear anon; and you will be the Hall, it ſeems, the ſtorehouſe which retains all blackneſs, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp;c. and from thence it cometh forth unto the reſt.</p>
            <p>You ſay, I ſet my ſelf againſt the Anabaptiſts themſelves, whom I canonize for Saints in the higheſt form; yet blame them for adhering to Ordinances. Its very falſe, there is no ſuch word written; but it is for making too much of them, not for making uſe of them: And if ſome fail, is it not lawful to reprove? but <hi>Thomas Hall</hi> muſt raiſe an untruth and reproach upon it, change my words for his own ends.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Its a great untruth to ſay I make them all ſo: that I ſay, is, that thoſe whom you falſely call <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and <hi>Independents</hi> are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments by which God hath given a being to you and the Nation: I deny not what was done by any at firſt; but I know not how it would have been at laſt, if God had not raiſed up the Spirits of ſome to ſtand in the gap; and your ſelves had like to have been the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments for ſelf-ends to have drawn on ruine, had not the Lord prevenced.</p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>He diſhonoureth and abuſeth the preſent Power, by Dedication of an abſurd, Heretical, Blaſphemous, non-Licenſed Pamphlet, called a Diſcourſe at</hi> Axbridge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I do affirm that none dare give ſuch vile titles to ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent truths, but thoſe whoſe eyes are blinded, and whoſe hearts are hardned, filled with all enmity againſt the truth of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thoſe who deſire further ſatisfaction, to the diſcourſe it ſelf.</p>
               <p>And truly we had need appeal to the Authority of the Nation for a civill preſervation, it being our Birthright; there being ſo many of your generation, men of blood, that will ſay, nay ſwear blaſphemy, Hereſie, any thing, that ſo you might be rid of us.</p>
               <p>Finally, I ſay no more to all your perverſe and raging accuſations, but the Lord rebuke thee.</p>

            <head>A Word of REPLY to <hi>Iohn Ferriby,</hi> in an Appendix to <hi>The Lawfull Preacher:</hi> called <hi>The Pulpit-Guard-Relieved.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, You call your Appendix <hi>The Pulpit-Guard Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved;</hi> But whether it be A Relief in good earneſt, I leave to the Reader to judge. If chiding, railing and reproaching be A Relief, then you have Relieved it; elſe not. And notwithſtanding your great ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling words, you'l find there is ſo much in that <hi>Pulpit-Rout,</hi> that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you nor all your Gang will ever be able to extinguiſh it. Rage you may, but ruin it you cannot.</p>
            <p>You ſay <hi>Page</hi> 2. That <hi>he is ſo bitter in his Expreſſions againſt the Gentleman, ſo loud in railing againſt the Coat, that he deſerves no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</hi> But you are miſtaken, Sir; they are not railings, but true diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of Wolves in Sheeps cloathing.</p>
            <p>But you ſay, <hi>You forbear, leſt in this the Proverb ſhould be verified, Like to like, quoth the Devil to the Collier.</hi> And who is worſt think you, the Devil or the Collier? By your own confeſſion you are the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, I the Collier. The Devil it is, it ſeems, ſpeaks to the Collier; and ſurely if the Collier did the Devils work, he would never reprove him for it. But if the Collier do the work of Chriſt, the Devil will fall upon him.</p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>You will not meddle with the Looking-glaſs: nor will you examine the Tryal and Verdict, nor take notice of the ſtrength of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wonder what then you will do; here's like to be a goodly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief anon; <hi>A Pulpit Relief,</hi> yet take no notice of the force of the Truth that lieth againſt it. It's juſt like to a company of men that will pretend they relieve a beſieged Gariſon, yet take no notice of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers, or will ſtand at a diſtance, and give great words, and ſo go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way boaſting that the Work is done; and the mean time the Beſieged periſh. Thus have you dealt with your <hi>Pulpit-Guard;</hi> And truly, had not I had other occaſions to write, I had never troubled my head or pen to have given you a word of Anſwer; And in this I ſhall give you but a word or two.</p>
            <p>Thus having ſhifted your ſelf from the ſubſtance of what is ſaid in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:199222:37"/> 
               <hi>The Pulpit Guard-Rout</hi> you pretend to give a Glympſe of his <hi>skill in the interpretation of Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Firſt is that of the Prieſts of the Law and the Miniſters of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>The Prieſthood under the Law typed out Chriſt, and he is the alone Prieſt by office. I deny not Miniſters by office under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; but that Miniſtry that is of Chriſt, never forbiddeth the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Brethren (who have received the Gift, though they never meddle with the office) but rather encourageth to it. 1. <hi>Pet</hi> 4. 10, 11.</p>
            <p>And it is a truth, that <hi>Corah's</hi> guilt was in doing that which was forbidden; but the Saints are Commanded to, and Commended for preaching. Commanded to it <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 3, 6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 31. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10. Commended for it 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. One Ordinance or Tradition, and that not the leaſt too, was that they might, nay that they ought to bring their gifts to the Church for the good of the whole. There are diverſities of gifts in the Church, and all for the good of the whole. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. And this Monopolizing ſpirit that hath ſo long reigned in thoſe who call themſelves Miniſters, hath been the cauſe of ſo much blindneſs in the World as hath been almoſt to this day. And as for the Calling of the Worldly Miniſtry, I leave the Reader to what is wrtten in <hi>The Pulpit-Guard Routed,</hi> to conſider whether it be from above or from beneath, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>You ſay <hi>Page</hi> 5. <hi>There is in my Book,</hi> Page 19. <hi>enough granted for your Purpoſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tis becauſe you do in this as in other things take but Part of what I ſay. For though I ſay that none can preach according to the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Scripture <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15. for the working of Faith and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of ſouls; yet it doth not follow that every Gifted Brother may not Preach.</p>
            <p>But you leave out that which follows. <hi>viz. for every Gifted Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is ſent to preach according to the meaſure of the Gift recieved.</hi> And the Miſtake lieth in the word <hi>ſent,</hi> thinking that none but men in Office are ſent of God to convert ſouls; when Gifted Brethren are ſometimes ſent though not in Office. Acts 8. 4. with 11. 19, 21.</p>
            <p>All you ſay in Anſwer to that <hi>that gifting is ſending &amp;c</hi> reacheth not the buſineſs in hand. For</p>
            <p n="1">1. It doth not appear in thoſe Scriptures you mention, <hi>Iſa</hi> 6 8, 9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10 1, 5. that they were firſt gifted, then ſent; Go tell them
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:199222:37"/> ſaith the Lord to <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> Gods putting the word in his mouth, was the gifting. Yet</p>
            <p n="2">2. I deny not in the ordinary way of propheſying and preaching gifting to precede ſending, firſt to thoſe who are authoritatively ſent by the Church; or ſecondly to thoſe who preach only by gift accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the meaſure of the gift received. It is ſending; and they may and ought according to the meaſure of the gift, both in the Church and out of the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> in the world as occaſion is offered, God in thoſe occaſions calling them to it, accordingly to adminiſter.</p>
            <p>Secondly you ſay, that <hi>he is very unhappy in confounding ordinary and extraordinary Caſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer firſt, that extraordinary Caſes make not that lawfull which in it ſelf is unlawfull, unleſs in caſes of neceſſity for preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of life: then <hi>I will have mercy, and not ſacrifice:</hi> unleſs it be in the bearing up of the name and truth of Chriſt; then <hi>he that will ſave his life, ſhall loſe it.</hi> Witneſs <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 13. 9. 10. for putting his hand to ſtay the Ark, was ſmote with death. So that your ſo often mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extraordinary caſes helps you nothing; for its not the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narineſs of the caſe that juſtifies the thing, if it be in it ſelf unlawfull; ſo that you do indeed condemn the practice of the Saints recorded in Scripture for our example, in <hi>Acts Chap.</hi> 8. and 11. with divers others; and all for the keeping up your own Ends and Intereſts. I am ſure if you ſtood in the counſel and truth of Jeſus, the preaching of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren could not, would not trouble you.</p>
            <p>As for what is ſaid from <hi>pag.</hi> 8 to 10. I refer the Reader to the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the aſſertions in my Book.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 9. You ſay, <hi>The Gentleman</hi> (Pretended Servants; for ſo the word <hi>Miniſter</hi> ſignifies; yet Gentle men-Maſters, Servants ruling o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Maſters) <hi>having ſaid that the Holy-Ghoſt commends Learning, he Replyes,</hi> pag. 41. <hi>Holy Ghoſt! is there any ſuch word in the Scripture</hi> as Ghoſt? You ſay <hi>How now! which way went the Spirit of God from him? what, immediately inſpired, yet ignorant of this? hath he forgotten Mat.</hi> 28. 20. <hi>&amp;c?</hi>

               </gap> ſignifiyeth <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> not <hi>ghoſt?</hi> and ſo it is tranſlated and read in all other languages except the Engliſh; and ſometimes its truly tranſlated in Engliſh too: and the word <hi>ghoſt</hi> is an old Engliſh Popiſh ugly word, which indeed if rightly conſidered, is not ſo fit to be given to the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <pb n="66" facs="tcp:199222:38"/>
            <p>As for the interpretation of I. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 31. 32. <hi>Let the ſpirits of the Prophets be ſubject to the Prophets;</hi> though I deny not what is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>v.</hi> 29. that the Prophets ſpeak two or three, and the others judge; for the Church is to judge of the doctrine taught in it; yet its evident to any whoſe eyes are not ſhut againſt the truth that the interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>v</hi> 31 &amp;; 32. is in <hi>v</hi> 33 <hi>for God is not the author of confuſion, but of peace.</hi> See his Brother <hi>Richard Sanders</hi> confuting this, in his <hi>Balm to heal religious wounds,</hi> pag. 202. he ſaith, <hi>The ſpirit of the Prophets was ſubject to the Prophets,</hi> that is, the Spirit of Propheſie was not ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent on them, but that they had power to contain themſelves, and to ſtay one for another, and ſo to ſpeak in order, &amp;c. Here <hi>Richard San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> confutes <hi>John Ferriby;</hi> let the Reader judge.</p>
            <p>As to what you ſay in the reſt, in way of Reply, there being no weight at all in it, I paſs by it, referring the Reader to the examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Book you pretend to Anſwer. Where I make no queſtion, but that the clearneſs of the truth aſſerted, will appear to the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of any unbyaſſed and impartial Reader.</p>
            <p>As for your reproachfull terms, which is indeed the ſum of all your Anſwer, I paſs it by as unworthy taking notice; leaving the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie betwixt both you and us unto the righteous Judge, who will in his own time bring it forth to the light, and put a difference between thoſe who ſerve the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and thoſe who ſerve their own bellies. To him and with him I leave the controverſie, who undoubtedly will plead his own Cauſe and Truth in his own Time.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Eeting with your Book, the Title beſpeaks what I find not in it. 1. You call it <hi>A Balm to heal Religious wounds,</hi> &amp;c. But when I came to take a view of it, I found it far from the nature of its name; but it rather tends to make the wounds deeper, and the breach wider: your book being ſtuffed with as much rancor almoſt in every page as any I have read, except <hi>Tho. Halls</hi> who writ the <hi>Pulpit</hi> and <hi>Font Guards.</hi> So that if what you ſay of mine were a truth, you have ballanced it on the other hand down to the ground, <hi>viz.</hi> with reproachfull terms: and as for that you call harſh language in mine, it is no other then what hath been given by the ſervants of the Lord in Scripture upon the like occaſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You call it, <hi>An Anſwer to the Pulpit-Guard Routed.</hi> Two open and cleer untruths in the Title. Firſt, <hi>A Balm to heal Religious wounds;</hi> when it is far from it. Secondly, <hi>An Anſwer to the Pulpit-Guard</hi>

               <hi>Routed;</hi> when you ſcarce come ſo neer as to meddle with it, unleſs with railing and reproachful terms; and if that be a ſufficient anſwer, you have done it to the purpoſe: Or ſecondly, in paſſing by the material and ſubſtantial things, you have culled out ſome few particular things, calling them <hi>Colliers</hi> Errors, when they are undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed truths, unleſs thoſe which are abuſed by you, changing the terms in which by me they were aſſerted; as will appear in its place.</p>
            <p>I paſs your Epiſtle, and come firſt to your five ſerious Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions.</p>
            <q>1. <hi>Qu.</hi> Whether ſuch an uncharitable, cenſorious, proud, diſdainfull, inveterate, calumniating spirit as works in this man (and others of the ſame lump) doth ever ſhew it ſelf in Scripture?</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If not, then you have declared your ſelf to be as far from the ſpirit of a Chriſtian upon the ſame account, as the <hi>Collier</hi> whom you ſo much reproach: witneſs this very queſtion propounded and almoſt every page in your book witneſſeth it; but I deſire not to ſcrape them up together.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, The truth of thoſe titles mentioned by you <hi>pag.</hi> 6. I leave to the Reader to judge; and if I am become your enemy for telling you the truth, I am contented through mercy to paſs under your cenſure.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Your</hi> 2. <hi>queſt.</hi> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon what ground (think you) ſhould he and men of the ſame temper and spirit with him, uſe ſuch bitterneſs againſt the Miniſtery, &amp;c.?</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. We never uſed ſuch bitterneſs againſt the Miniſtery of the Nation as they have againſt us. We never deſired to get an Ordinance from both Houſes of Parliament, to have them burnt in the forehead with the letter <hi>B.</hi> to have them impriſoned without Bail or Main-priſe, &amp;c. Though this is no ground to retort bitterneſs again in way of revenge, but rather to pitty them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is not their perſons, but their deſtructive Principles againſt which I write: the Lord who knoweth all things, knoweth that I lye not. I ſhould rejoyce in their converſion; and do not queſtion but that there are many that are honeſt and godly of them yet in <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon;</hi> and their duty is to come forth: and till then, blame us not for our dealing faithfully, though ſometimes ruggedly with them. And I would have you to know, that it is not a power to perſecute them we look for; no, I had a thouſand times rather <hi>Thomas Halls</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:199222:39"/> deſire were granted to him, that I with my books were burnt together, then to have a hand in the perſonal perſecution of <hi>Tho. Hall,</hi> your ſelf, or any other, for any principle or practiſe you hold in Conſcience, though it be known to me that it is contrary to truth.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Your</hi> 3. <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether this open enmity againſt the Miniſtery of <hi>England,</hi> which theſe men proclaim to all the world, inveighing againſt them as Antichriſtian, be not a thing abhorred of all gracious hearts? <hi>For proof of this you produce Mr.</hi> Tho. Goodwyn, <hi>Mr.</hi> Philip Nye, <hi>Mr.</hi> Sidrach Simpſon, <hi>Mr.</hi> Jeremiah Burroughs, <hi>Mr.</hi> William Bridge. Apol. Nar. <hi>p</hi> 6.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The honeſty of theſe men I queſtion not: Yet firſt, what they ſay proves not the truth of what you deſire; for it is not the teſtimony of men, but of God in the Scripture, that will juſtifie both Miniſtry and Church. And if that would do it, I could produce others of the ſame way, (I ſuppoſe none will deny but that they were equal with them for godlineſs and learning) who ſay the contrary. <hi>Ainſworth, Smith, Robinſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſeem to propound a ſtrange Querie, <hi>pag.</hi> 14. <hi>Whither would theſe men tranſport and carry you? Not only off from Presbytery, but Independents, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> In the light and power of truth, we would carry them to the Lord Jeſus; that ſo they might know and obey him, and worſhip the Father in him in ſpirit and in truth: and this is the utmoſt that we deſire.</p>
            <p>And truly, this is that which is my principle and practiſe, 1. That we are juſtified freely by grace; And 2. that this Juſtification where it is in truth enjoyed, works over ſouls to a holy and humble walking with the Lord, and obedience to him in all things. That it is the duty of Believers, according to the command of Chriſt, and practiſe of his ſervants in the Primitive times, to be baptized, and ſo come into Church fellowſhip, walking as with the Lord, ſo one with another in love, performing all duties of brotherly love, as becometh ſouls made one in ſo high and heavenly a calling. And hither it is we would tranſport and carry every ſoul that knows the Lord; and this is a journey, that you who call your ſelves <hi>Miniſters,</hi> cannot endure to undertake, nor ſuffer thoſe that would.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> Though it hath been the deſign of the enemies of truth ſo to do; yet, 1. That juſtifies not you to be the godly Miniſters. And 2. The ſervants of the Lord may not neglect their duty in reproving ſin where they find it, becauſe enemies to truth oppoſe the Miniſters of Chriſt. And 3. We give grounds from Scripture for what we ſay and do. Juſtifie your ſelves to be the Miniſters of Chriſt by your works accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Scripture, and we have done: till then, forbear giving ſuch lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as you do to the ſervants of the Lord for their impartial pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing and profeſſing of truth. You'll one day be aſhamed of it.</p>
            <p>So you ſay you come to his Errors, which are many.</p>
            <div n="1" type="error">
               <head>His firſt Error.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the life of Miniſters and Schollers educated in Schools of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is an idle life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. There are no ſuch words in my book; neither is there any truth in what you ſay: but that which I ſay, is, that God hath always in all ages made uſe of men of Callings to be the Miniſters of his mind unto the people; and I deſired you to produce any example in the Scripture, that God made choice of any to be the Miniſters of his mind unto the people, who were bred up idly all dayes of their life without a Calling.</p>
               <p>I do not ſay that the life of the Miniſters of Chriſt is an idle life; no, I know the contrary: but that which I ſay, is, that you can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce no example of any that were bred up idly without a Calling, called to be Miniſters: yet you will have Idlers, and none but them by your wils; and God muſt have them, or elſe he muſt have none at all. You ſay, o confirm this, he ſayes, <hi>A Calling is that in and by which men in the ſweat of their face get their living.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:199222:40"/>
               <p>You anſwer, <hi>O brave definition of a Calling, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I wonder you had not fallen foul with the Scripture, and have blamed him that commanded it; but you are ſo wiſe and honeſt as to leave out the Scriptures that I grounded my definition upon. <hi>Gen</hi> 3. 19. <hi>In the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eat bread till thou return to the duſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Query.</hi> Doth the Lord here intend, that ſome men muſt eat bread in the ſweat of their faces, and others muſt live idle?</q>
               <p>The other Scripture, is Eph. 4. 28. But you Anſwer. 1. <hi>Is every thing a man doth get a living by, a lawfull calling; then he that ſweats by robbing and ſtealing, lives by a lawfull calling, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It ſeems you have a minde to quarrell againſt the Truth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the word <hi>(lawfull)</hi> is not put in, you will conclude Robbery is lawful do not you diſcover ignorance or wilfulneſs, quarrelling againſt the very plain words of the Scripture, which ſaith, <hi>In the ſweat of thy face, thou ſhalt eat thy bread, &amp;c.</hi> he doth not ſay, in the lawfull ſweat of thy face; but that is implyed in the words; ſo when I ſay in the ſweat of mens face they ſhould get their bread, its intended lawfully; not by robbing and ſtealing; and truly you manifeſt your ſelf to be no friend to Truth in drawing ſuch a concluſion from ſuch clear and undeniable premiſes: I am confident never a Robber in this Nation durſt to have drawn ſuch a concluſion from ſuch undoubted truth and Scripture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You ſay, <hi>Is there no lawfull Calling but that whereby a man gets his living in the ſweat of his face? what will you ſay then of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, Juſtices of the Peace &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are not bred up Juſtices of the Peace, but are, or ſhould be bred up in ſome Calling: I am ſure the Scripture allows of idleneſs in none, though there may be a difference in labour; yet I ſuppoſe that leſs then this ſhould not be in the breeding of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt mens children in the Nation, to be able to do things of Husbandry, that ſo they may be able to manage their eſtates the better, and know themſelves when their buſineſs is well done.</p>
               <p>And ſo they may be the better fitted for their Calling, as Magiſtrates, Juſtices of the Peace, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>You ſay, <hi>Will he call the Parliament Idlers, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alas man! he knows the Parliament is a particular Calling while it continues, the Members of it being called and ſent up by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and they being faithfull in it ſerve the Country.</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:199222:41"/>
               <p>As for <hi>Phyſitians,</hi> I queſtion not their Calling; that relates unto the body; but there is a difference between a Phyſitian of the body and of the Soul; the one is natural, therefore needs time of ſtudy to finde out the natural Cauſes and Remedies: and I queſtion not the lawfulneſs of breeding to School till men are fit for thoſe Callings to which they are appointed; but the Calling of the Miniſter is not a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Calling, but a Spiritual; and only God fits and enables to it; therefore for men to live out of a Calling to fit themſelves for the Miniſtry, is a very corrupt and dangerous thing; for in concluſion they muſt be Miniſters right or wrong; they were bred up unto it; they expect a maintenance from it, &amp;c. Whereas the Miniſters of Chriſt have ever been choſen upon another account; <hi>viz.</hi> God gives gifts, and the Church chooſes, and they are called from one Calling to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet may lawfully live in the uſe of both.</p>
               <p>Then you ſay, <hi>Taylors, Button-makers, Seamſters, &amp;c. becauſe they do not ſweat at it, eſpecially in the Winter, are not lawfull Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alas man! blindneſs with a witneſs; if you quarrell ſo much with the word, <hi>ſweat,</hi> why do you not quarrell againſt him who firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it? But do you not know, firſt, that there is no Calling, but that ſometimes thoſe implyed in it may, nay, do <hi>ſweat.</hi> 2. That the word, <hi>ſweat,</hi> primarily relates to a mans diligence in his Calling, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imployed about ſomething that may adminiſter to his neceſſity, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scripture, ſo not living idly;</p>
               <p n="3">3. You ſay, <hi>Is it ſo, that none live in a lawfull Calling, but he that works with his hands? what think you of</hi> Paul, 1 Cor. 9. 6. <hi>have not we power to forbear working, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I did not, nor do not affirm that thoſe who are the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt, lawfully called, &amp;c. may not forbear working; but that they ought not to be bred up idle, till they are called; and that God always maketh choice of men of particular Callings. 2. That <hi>Paul</hi> might forbear work, not that he muſt do it; for he did work, <hi>His hands miniſtred to his neceſſities, for the Goſpels ſake.</hi> I wonder when we ſhall finde any of you Miniſters of the Nation in that temper?</p>
               <p n="4">4. You ſay, <hi>Is there no laboriouſneſs and pains taking in the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Miniſtry, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I know there is; and notwithſtanding you ſay, <hi>that it appears by his book, he is not acquainted with the labour of the minde in getting</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:199222:41"/> 
                  <hi>down to the bottom of things.</hi> Sir, I have through grace gone ſo to the bottom of things, as hath and will root up all your Religion, root and branch, Miniſtry, Church, Ordinances and all; therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear complaining of the want of going to the bottom of things; and I doubt not but that I ſhall go to the bottom of your Book too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have ended.</p>
               <p>But you ſay he adds, <hi>Breeding to School is proper to children when they cannot labour, to fit them for ſome Calling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You pretend, <hi>That Infants are able to labour almoſt aſſoon as they are able to go to School, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If you were not ignorant at beſt, or envious, you might underſtand that Infants are not able to labour in their Callings aſſoon as able to go to School; and I dare affirm, that there is time enough for children to get Learning to fit them for any Calling in this Nation, before they have ability of body to perform it. I do not judge children ſufficiently capable in body for a Calling untill 14. years of Age, and here is time enough for children to get Learning; as for Univerſities, we read of none in Scripture; and <hi>Simſon</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtory of the Church</hi> ſaith that <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> and <hi>Pantenus</hi> were the Authors of Univerſities and Colledges, p. 259.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſay, That children may be fit for ſome Callings before they be for others; and according as the Calling is unto which they are inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, may their Parents give the time of breeding them, ſome more, and ſome leſs, untill fit and able to manage that Calling unto which they are appointed; yet all this makes nothing at all for the breeding up of Miniſters, unleſs you will make a Trade of it; which I perceive is the great Work you are about. When men are thus bred up and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for, and imployed in ſome lawfull Calling, if God now mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt his Son to and in ſuch a one, inabling him to the Work of the Lord in his own heart, and in the judgement of the Church, he may lawfully, nay he ought to ſubmit unto the Call of God, be he high or low; from the Speaker of the Houſe, or Preſident of the Counſell of State, unto the Hewer of wood and Drawer of water; and this is a true Call, when thus called of God: therefore all you ſay to this, is but an idle fancy; you have no ground for it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>That Infant-Baptiſm is a childiſh thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this you ſay, <hi>He will own for a Truth:</hi> And this I do ſay, I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:199222:42"/> ſtill own for a Truth, and that firſt in <hi>the Subject.</hi> 2. <hi>In the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſay, <hi>There is an Objection lies in the way, which he ſets down,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Infants of the children of Iſrael were as uncapable of the underſtanding of the myſterie of Circumciſion, as Infants are now of Baptiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Anſwers (though reproached by you, I ſuppoſe its not for want of ignorance) (I ſhall relate them again, and leave them to the judgement of the Reader; only, adding one more) will ſtand, and their truth be manifeſt, when what you practiſe will fall in the ſtreets.</p>
               <p>Its truth, that one part of Circumciſions Myſtery, <hi>viz.</hi> the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of the heart, was as far from the capacity of Infants, as the myſterie of Baptiſm is now.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As Circumciſion was a Type and Figure in the fleſh of Chriſt, who was to come of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed; and there was no ſuch capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city required, becauſe it was a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Legal Type, as all the reſt of their external Worſhips and Sacrifices were, leading to, and repreſenting the coming of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the fleſh. <hi>That theſe are not words to pleaſe children as you pretend, unleſs you mean the children of God;</hi> but words of truth, it will appear, if the honeſt Reader do but conſider, that as all the Ordinances of the <hi>Jews</hi> were Carnal and Typical, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16, 17. So thoſe Ordinances were given to the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or Carnal Seed, <hi>viz.</hi> the Seed of the Fleſh, which was Typical like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe as their Ordinances were; therefore was not the like capacity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in them, as in thoſe in the Goſpel days, who are directly led into the Myſterie unto <hi>Jeſus</hi> who is come, being the ſubſtance of all thoſe Types and ſhadows.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There was a Command for that of Circumciſion; none for that of Baptiſm: you cry out, <hi>O egregiouſly gifted Diſputant!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> O egregiouſly ignorant! Is it not the Command that gives a capacity to the one and to the other? If the Lord Command the one, and not the other, is not that enough to ſilence man for ever? <hi>Zac.</hi> 2. 13. I ſay its the Command of God that gives a capacity to the creature of obeying; and there are none capable of a Duty but thoſe that are called to the Duty; and this you confeſs your ſelf, p. 86. that in weighty things of God, a Chriſtian muſt have a certain evident Rule to warrant his practiſe. Whereas you ſay, <hi>They were therefore circumciſed, becauſe taken into the Covenant, and ſo Church Members;</hi> I ſhall Anſwer it in its place, and ſay ſomething to it in my fourth An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:199222:42"/>
               <p>I ſhall adde a fourth, and that is, They were capable of thoſe things promiſed to them in that Covenant, viz. <hi>The Land of Canaan;</hi> and only the ſpiritual ſeed are capable of thoſe things promiſed in the Goſpel-Covenant, viz. The ſpiritual Land, Jeſus Chriſt, and all the good things of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſay its childiſh, as relating to the Adminiſtrators, &amp;c. and you give a clear anſwer to it of juſt nothing. I refer the Reader to it.</p>

                  <hi>That none muſt be baptized until they come to perfect age.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this you ſeem to give a learned Anſwer, crying out of <hi>Ignorance;</hi> and where it is, let the Reader judge by the Scriptures I produce: Was not Chriſt himſelf baptized at thirty years of age? The Eunuch by <hi>Philip?</hi> Acts 8. 37. And thoſe that came to <hi>Iohn?</hi> Mat. 3. and thoſe Acts 2. 40, 41?</p>

               </p>
               <p>I ſhall make uſe of your own words before: <hi>O egregiouſly gifted Disputant!</hi> What, are you ſo well verſt, that we muſt prove Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives?

               </p>
               <p>I ſay, <hi>Is there one rule for them, and another for us now? if there be, produce it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this you learnedly anſwer: <hi>If he did underſtand ſenſe, he would ſee that the ſame Scripture-rule that was then given to the Churches, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects us to a different courſe in gathering of Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And truly I muſt be mighty wiſe then to underſtand that which is not for mine own ends; ſuch ſenſe will prove ſenſual in the end, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 13, 14, 15, 16. and this is the ſumme of what you ſay; only you would flatter the people with your love to them; and its manifeſt it is in darkening the Truth. You have produced no Scripture for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rule to us, then that to them, although I called for it, but only Rev. 2. 2. <hi>Try them that ſay they are Apoſtles, and are not, but lyars.</hi> I ſay ſo too, and earneſtly deſire, nay charge thoſe who have any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

               <p>As for thoſe conſequences mentioned; as that of Circumciſion, the Houſholds, and thoſe brought to Chriſt, &amp;c.

               <p>Immediatly you confeſs, that its true, <hi>The firſt conſequence is made uſe of;</hi> but come hither all you that fear the Lord, ſee what a ſhift this man makes to help himſelf; he takes it for granted, that I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that baptiſm is come in the room of Circumciſion: when I do but declare your falſe and nonſenſical conſequences, not mine own concluſion. I deny Baptiſm to be come in the room of Circumciſion; my grounds you may ſee in the <hi>Font-Guard Routed,</hi> in my anſwer to Doctor <hi>Hall;</hi> yet if it were true, that Baptiſm were come in the room of Circumciſion, as <hi>Richard Sanders</hi> would have it, let the babes and ſucklings come and ſee what ground here will be for Infant bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: let Jeſus Chriſt be King, let him have but ſo much honour, as to tell you who ſhall be baptized, and how it ſhall be done, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie will be ended: <hi>If you think Chriſt as a Son to be faithful in his houſe, as Moſes a Servant was faithful in his houſe,</hi> Heb. 3. 2, 3, 4, 5. then he hath left ſufficient rules for his people to walk by; they need not leave the ſon, and go back to the ſervant, <hi>Act</hi> 2. 22. but you ask <hi>What he hath to ſay to this conſequence?

The reaſon is, becauſe that Circumciſion was that in which the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were engaged to obedience, and the whole Law was included in it, when firſt given, or elſe by it they could not be bound over to the whole Law; ſo that the uniting of Law and Circumciſion together ſo inſeparably, being indeed both typicall, muſt ſtand and fall together; <hi>Moſes</hi> being
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:199222:43"/> the ſervant in that houſe, all the Ordinances being typicall, and the ſervant too. Circumciſion is reckoned with the reſt of the Law, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together upon <hi>Moſes</hi> account; therefore, next quarrel with Chriſt, and lay the blame (if there be ſo much) where it is.

               <p>If <hi>Collier</hi> had ſo contradicted one Argument with another, you would have branded him for an <hi>Ignoramus.</hi> In the former Argument you ſay, <hi>Some Infants are Church-members, therefore ought to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</hi> In this you ſay, as in confirmation of the former, <hi>Some Infants were once to be admitted members,</hi> ſo that it ſuppoſeth a time when they were not members; and you ſeem to contradict your ſelf, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what I have ſaid, <hi>viz. That Church-members are not admitted to Baptiſm, but they are admitted to memberſhip by Baptiſm, or becauſe baptized:</hi> but your ſelf-contradiction I paſs, only minde it by the way.</p>

               <p>And 2. I come to your invincible Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> upon your own account: and the ſtrength of your Argument I perceive lies in this, <hi>Not yet repealed.</hi> Let all the reſt paſs for truth, yet let this be denied, and it comes all to nothing. You ſay <hi>p.</hi> 38. <hi>God never repealed this grant to Infants, &amp;c.</hi> I ſhall (as I have done in the former Treatiſe) prove the Repeal, and then your Argument is fallen. I prove it thus:</p>
               <list type="syllogism">
                  <item>If the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> in which Infants had thoſe priviledges you ſpeak of, and Church memberſhip, &amp;c. be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, then the priviledges of the Covenant are repealed.</item>
                  <item>But the Covenant it ſelf is repealed. </item>
                  <item>Therefore the priviledges of that Covenant are repealed.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is cleer: The <hi>Minor I</hi> prove.</p>
               <list type="syllogism">
                  <item>That Covenant whoſe promiſes and priviledges were typical, when the ſubſtance was come, was repealed.</item>
                  <item>But the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all its promiſes and priviledges were typical.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> When the ſubſtance was come, it was all repealed.</item>
               </list>
               <p>That the Covenant was typical, <hi>I</hi> ſhall prove; and it typed out Chriſt and the ſpiritual ſeed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Covenant typed out Chriſt: for the Covenant on Gods part was, That he would give unto them the <hi>Land of Canaan for an everlaſting poſſeſſion.</hi> This Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was typical, of which Chriſt was the ſubſtance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. from <hi>v.</hi> 7. to 11. Therefore when Chriſt the ſubſtance was come, the type was repealed; and our Covenant now is not of the outward Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but of the true Spiritual Land of reſt. And if the Covenant it ſelf be repealed, as none who have their eyes in their heads but may ſee it, then the Church-memberſhip of that Covenant is repealed; and the Church-memberſhip of the Goſpel is a Church-memberſhip of <hi>another Covenant, a better Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes,</hi> Heb. 8. therefore another Church-memberſhip. Such as are capable of that Covenant and promiſe, to wit the Spiritual ſeed, are members of the Spiritual promiſe.</p>
               <p>And leſt any ſhould think there was a difference between the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that made with <hi>Moſes, I</hi> cannot paſs it thus: for it was all one. When <hi>Moſes</hi> was raiſed up, it was gathered into one Covenant, and related all to one thing. Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion is given by <hi>Moſes;</hi> the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> was the ſame as made to <hi>Moſes,</hi> to wit, the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> therefore the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:199222:44"/> mentioned <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. is ſaid to be <hi>eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes,</hi> becauſe it was a better Covenant; that is, better promiſes then the <hi>Land of Canaan,</hi> viz. the <hi>Heavenly Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any man dare to ſay, that it is the ſame Covenant as that with <hi>Abraham;</hi> let him take heed, fear and tremble to give God the lye: God one day will appear to be a <hi>God of truth,</hi> and all ſelf-ſeeking and gainſaying men will be ſound lyars. If any deſire to ſee further into this truth, let them have recourſe unto my former Treatiſe <hi>(Font-Guard Routed)</hi> in anſwer unto the ſame Argument.</p>
               <p>And as to your Arguments to prove the Negative, <hi>That this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull grant is not revoked; if it be, it muſt be in mercy or judgment, &amp;c. I</hi> trace you not in it; <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe to any reaſonable man it will be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs: For if it be cleer as the Sun, that it is repealed; whether in mercy or judgment, to us is not material. Yet this <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſay, that it is in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and much wiſdom; <hi>For all the works of God are wrought in mercy and truth.</hi> It was the will and wiſdom of God, that the <hi>Natural ſeed ſhould have an intereſt in the outward Covenant,</hi> and that the <hi>Spiritual ſeed ſhould have a true intereſt in the ſpiritual Covenant and priviledges.</hi> Therefore ceaſe reaſoning thus: <hi>let God be true;</hi> let God have his will, though he take away all cauſe of fleſhly boaſting from us: For now we have no intereſt in any thing in this Covenant, unleſs Chriſt be ours; and if Chriſt be ours, then <hi>all is ours;</hi> but loſe him, and loſe all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 21, 22.</p>

               <head>You come (you ſay) to his fourth Error.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>That God now reveals his will not only by the written word, but by dreams and viſions, more credited then the Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This you aſſert; it's none of mine; as the Reader may ſee, if he pleaſe to peruſe the place. It is your own invention, and a lying one too. And to this you adde another as great immediately following, <hi>viz.</hi> That you believe the Priſon at <hi>London</hi> had done me good, where you heard I lately was for my Hereſies.</p>
               <p>Strange man I you are ſpeaking againſt Dreams, and yet are in the very <hi>interim</hi> dreaming: you did but dream that I was in priſon, and I ſuppoſe it was becauſe you would have it ſo; you had ſtudied deep upon the point the day before, and ſo it ſeems you dream'd the thing was done. What, <hi>Richard Sanders</hi> dream a lye? if he can dream no better then that, he were as good give off dreaming, or at leaſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to publiſh it in writing, leſt all men count him but as he is. And
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:199222:45"/> what I ſay of Dreaming, is no more but this; that I dare not condemn the thing, becauſe God hath not limited himſelf; he may reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf which way he pleaſeth, though not contrary, but agreeable to the Scripture. And further, that it is not my experience, nor any of that <hi>I</hi> know; therefore may be a whimſie of <hi>Tho Halls</hi> own head.</p>
               <p>This is the ſubſtance of what <hi>I</hi> ſay; yet you dare to aſſert, that <hi>I</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that God reveals his will that way, &amp; that its more to be credited then the written word; when all <hi>I</hi> ſay, is, that for all that <hi>I</hi> know, ſome may have ſomething revealed thar way, although <hi>I</hi> know it not. See Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> in the Book of Martyrs, <hi>vol.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 607. he relates of that good Martyr Mr. <hi>Philpot,</hi> in a dream or viſion he ſaw as it were a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious City full of excellencies, &amp;c. and it brought much joy to his ſoul; it was cleered to him that it was a repreſentation of the glorious Church of Chriſt: and dare you ſay this was falſe?

               <p>It ſeems you reſolved to lye when you began, and ſo you will do it to the purpoſe: but you are driven to confeſs the truth immediately, that every one that runs may read you. While any lives in the cleer enjoyment of mercy, it is form and cuſtom that carries them to that petition; but if a ſoul apprehends want of pardon, let him ask it. And is this ſo ſtrange unto you? truly <hi>I</hi> do not wonder; <hi>I</hi> believe it is in good earneſt as ſtrange as you make it. It ſeems you know not that <hi>there is a time for all things, and every thing in its ſeaſon is ſweet and comely.</hi> There is a time to ask pardon, and a time to rejoyce in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of pardon; there is a time to be merry &amp; a time to be ſorry: <hi>If any be merry,</hi> ſaith <hi>James, let him ſing; if afflicted, let him pray.</hi> And for that word, <hi>If any ſoul, or when a ſoul apprehends the want of pardon, let him ask it;</hi> its no otherwiſe then what <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>If any want wiſdom, let him ask of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jam</hi> 1. 5.

               <p>
                  <hi>That gifted Brethren may exerciſe the Miniſterial or Paſtoral act of Preaching in a conſtituted Church, without any Call to the Office of a Miniſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I ſuppoſe it's impoſſible for you to ſtate any thing truly as it was laid down by me. But that you pretend, that what I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>is ſo full of contradictions, that in ſober ſadneſs you know not what I would have.</hi> Truly in ſober-ſadneſs I am much of the mind, that your mind in writing was rather to make the Truth, and my ſelf its ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant contemptible to the people, then to anſwer the truth written in my book: for elſe you durſt not change my language into your own ſo oft as you do; and then rail, and pretend you anſwer me; nay, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend you know not what I would have, when it is ſo cleerly aſſerted from Scripture grounds, not only in the generall, but in particular, <hi>pag.</hi> 95. 96. in ſeven or eight particulars: and I ſhall at preſent mind but one, which is the firſt; That all the brethren in the Church that have the gift, may propheſie. You aſſert it thus; <hi>That they may exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the Miniſterial or Paſtoral act,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Well, but you pretend you will not anſwer the Arguments; that you will leave to your brother <hi>Hall.</hi> But you pittifully cry out of <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the Collier:</hi> but I ſuppoſe, and its not my ſuppoſition only, that it is your own pittifull ignorance makes you ſo to cry out againſt me: for the Arguments you paſs; nor do you ſay any thing of ſubſtance unto thoſe things you pretend to be Errors. You ſay, you will lay down ſome Obſervations, <hi>which may ſerve as a key to ſee the weakneſs, ignorance, and impertinency of the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You obſerve, <hi>p.</hi> 66. <hi>That I do pittifully ſay, I Sir, and No Sir.</hi> And is this ſuch a pittiful thing? Let the Reader judge.</p>
               <p>As to your 7 particulars inſtanced, there is no contradiction in them. For firſt, that gifted brethren may preach according to their gift both in and out of a conſtituted Church, is cleer; and there is not any thing you have ſaid that bears the leaſt ſhew of a ſolid anſwer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. For both of theſe, ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 3. 6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10, 11. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 4. with <hi>chap.</hi> 11. 19, 20, 21. &amp; <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 20. &amp; <hi>chap.</hi> 18. 25, 26. in all which it appears, the lawfulneſs of the Preaching of gifted Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, both in and out of the Church; and truly I cannot think that you are ſo ignorant of this Truth as you pretend; only you are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to make a Trade of Preaching; that ſo you may uphold your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:199222:46"/> and profit; and that diſtinction between Gift and Office is as clear as the Sun; and you ſay nothing in anſwer unto it from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but in way of compariſon with the Magiſtrate, which will not hold: for men have preached, and it was their duty, without the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, only by Gift, as in the former Scriptures; but men may not be Magiſtrates, unleſs called to office; and the diſproportion between things Spiritual and things natural, is that in which natural men are loſt, and the wiſdom of man cannot reach it.</p>
               <p>But you ſeem with <hi>Tho. Hall,</hi> to make much ado about private Preaching; and to confirm it you produce two Arguments. 1. <hi>If we finde in Scripture that all Chriſtians may preach, taking preaching in a large ſence for private duties we owe one to another, &amp;c.</hi> But you prove by Scripture that all Chriſtians may Preach, take Preaching in a large ſence, &amp;c. How now <hi>Richard Sanders;</hi> why you are proving more then ever I aſſerted: Where will you be anon? they may Preach, and they may not; for that which I aſſerted, was, that gifted brethren might Preach; you ſay all.</p>
               <p>Query 1. <hi>Whether theſe Scriptures produced by you, do at all speak of Preaching?</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 18. <hi>comfort one another with theſe words,</hi> Heb. 3. 13. <hi>But exhort one another daily, while it is called to day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Qu. 2. <hi>If it do infer Preaching, why not publick in the Church? If they were to exhort one another, why not in the Church? What word is there that hinders that it was not in the Church, and ſo publick?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe in the reſt of the Scriptures; ſo that by all that is ſaid, here is no room for private Preaching, unleſs particular exhortation; ſo men in office may preach as well as men out of office; So that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is a private watching in the Church of Chriſt, and a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate admonition, exhortation, &amp;c. you will therefore call it private Preaching; and if you make that Preaching, then you think to limit all the gifts in the Church there, ſo contradicting all the Scriptures before mentioned: and its true all are not teachers in way of Office: yet all that have gifts, may, nay ought to make uſe of them for the good of the body and the glory of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Argument is taken from women. <hi>If it be lawfull for women to preach privately, &amp;c. But women may preach private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here you lie pittifully in the duſt; let the Reader peruſe the Scripture produced by you for proof of your aſſertion, that women may Preach, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. See if there be ever a word
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:199222:46"/> of Preaching in that place, or any thing that hath a tendency to it. Surely you think people are ſo ignorant that the very mentioning of Scripture will ſatisfie them, although it be nothing to the purpoſe; the other Scripture <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 26. The text ſaith, it was <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> his wife. The word is, <hi>expounded the way of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> But how will you prove that it was <hi>Priſcilla</hi> that expounded? Why not <hi>Aquila,</hi> if it muſt be preaching, as well as <hi>Priſcilla?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what ſhould I rake after ſuch nonſence and confuſion? I do not in the leaſt queſtion the womens Duty in their ſtation, as well as all the brethrens, which is to watch, to reprove, to reſtore, to exhort, &amp;c. yet this prevents not the brethrens Duty, who have received Gifts from the Lord to make uſe of them publickly for the good of the whole: and they juſtly forfeit them if they neglect, and they may be taken from them, and given to thoſe who will better improve them; and I am confident that the gifts of Chriſt in the Saints, will confound and bring to nothing the Worldly Miniſtry, and that ſo much the rather too, becauſe they ſo much envy and oppoſe the Truth, and way of God in this particular.</p>
               <p>You obſerve 3ly. <hi>That I take no notice of the thing in hand, when the queſtion is ſtated, Whether any may Preach in a conſtituted Church, not called to Office? the Scriptures my anſwers are grounded upon, ſpeak only of Preaching to Infidels, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> If you were not wilfull or blinde, you might ſee, that I prove Preaching both in, and out of a conſtituted Church too; the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures I produced for Preaching in a conſtituted Church, are <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 3. 6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 31. and that it intends the Brethren without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 1. where he ſpeaks to the Church, <hi>Deſire ſpiritual gifts, but rather that ye may propheſie,</hi> and none are excepted but wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>ver.</hi> 34. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10, 11. and as for that you make ſo much ado about, the <hi>extraordinarineſs of the caſe of the Preaching of the ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered brethren to Infidels:</hi> I have anſwered it in the former Treatiſe; yet ſomething ſhall I ſay here; 1. An unlawfull thing is not made lawful by the extraordinarineſs of the caſe, unleſs in caſe of ſaving life; ſo the Lord <hi>will have mercy and not ſacrifice,</hi> as in the Scripture men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by you; provided it be not in the profeſſion of Chriſt; then <hi>he that to ſave his life will deny Chriſt before men, he will deny him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Father which is in heaven;</hi> ſo that neceſſity makes not an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull thing lawfull: If <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> touch the Ark, he muſt die, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:199222:47"/> 6. 6, 7. But 2. What neceſſity was there in it, that <hi>Paul,</hi> or the ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Brethren or <hi>Apollo</hi> ſhould preach? if it were unlawfull, there was no neceſſity, unleſs ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> minds, <hi>A neceſſity is upon me, and wo is me if I preach not the Goſpel,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 16. And if this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity was upon them I think it was lawfull, and upon the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is it lawfull for any of the Saints that have received the Gift to Preach; therefore for ſhame forbear to tell of the extraordinarineſs of the Caſe any more, if the thing in it ſelf was lawfull: and do not abuſe the Scripture for the upholding of your own ends and intereſts, and do no more charge folly upon the Servants of the Lord for their fulfilling of the will of Chriſt. And whereas you pretend, <hi>That one Scripture witneſſing that God hath appointed and fixed ſome in office for the work of the Miniſtry, is of more ſtrength to condemn the liberty of preaching pleaded for, then twenty Examples of gifted mens prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</hi> Let the Reader judge of the truth of this, or whether both theſe held forth in Scripture do not clearly ſpeak thus much to it, that both are to have being together, not one to put out the other; and that Office that thinks to ſilence Gift, is no Office of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> but that which ſeeks it ſelf, and its reward will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
               <p>But I might conclude more ſure then you, that there being a fixed Scripture that Commands Baptizing of Believers, is of ſtrength e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to condemn a thouſand conſequences for ſprinkling of Infants, having not ſo much as any preſident for it: you would feign preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents for ſprinkling of Infants if you could; but you endeavour to overturn Preſidents of preaching Brethren that they ſhould not be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to us; let the people judge of what Spirit you are of: And the reaſon I judge is this, your own ſtanding depends ſo poſitively upon it, that unleſs you can uphold the one and ſuppreſs the other, you are like to fall together.</p>
               <p>Obſerv. 4. <hi>That in my pleading for a general liberty of Preaching in a conſtituted Church, I do not inform how far I extend it, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be with the conſent of the Paſtor and people, or whether he may Preach whether they will or no?</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I leave the truth of this likewiſe to the Reader to judge; whether it be not often aſſerted in my Book, pag 29. <hi>The Churches freedom or deſire is Call enough, if the party be gifted to it; all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Calls to Preach either within or without are ſutable to the Gift,</hi> pag. 30. <hi>The Church hath power to Call forth a gifted Brother to do</hi>

               <p>The ntxt Scripture is <hi>Pſal</hi> 145. 10, 11. All you ſay to this is very learnedly; <hi>As though this hath any relation to publick preaching,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>they ſhall make known to the ſons of men his mighty Acts and the glorious Majeſty of his Kingdom;</hi> but this you have left out; you durſt not put it in your Book, leſt the Reader ſhould ſee your folly.

               <p>And you ſay, <hi>That your great work ſhall be to prove that prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 31. <hi>was extraordinary, and not ordinary,</hi> as the <hi>Pulpit-Guard-Routed</hi> ſayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You ſay, <hi>You read,</hi> p. 60. <hi>that the reaſon why propheſie was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary in the Law, and this ordinary</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 3. <hi>is becauſe its a ſpeaking to edification, exhortation and comfort, &amp;c.</hi> The ſubſtance of what you ſeem to anſwer to this is, 1.

               </p>
               <p>But give me leave to ſhew your Sophiſtry; and that firſt in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending an Anſwer, when tis nothing to the purpoſe; the end of my uſing theſe words, was to preſent the Reader with the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Propheſie of the Old Teſtament, which was to foretell things to come, and this of the New; this 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. is an ordinary way of propheſie for the building up of the Church, that ſo all <hi>may be inſtructed, and all may be comforted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p>2. You ſay, <hi>The Prophets under the Law ſpake to edification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer. There is none queſtions that, but that their propheſyings had that end in it: and its ſo to us at this day, when we come to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them; but the propheſying mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ordinary propheſying in the Church, for the edification of the Body: That in the Law was a foretelling of things to come, and therefore written, to be kept on Record to poſterity; this not written, becauſe ordinary, and as <hi>Thomas Hall</hi> confeſſeth, it was ſuch a prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, as in it they <hi>might err, &amp;c.</hi> So that I ſay again, they under the Law took not their denomination from this kind of propheſying, <hi>viz.</hi> an ordinary ſpeaking to build up ſouls in the preſent knowledge of God; but from their receiving their propheſie immediatly from God, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering things to come.</p>
               <p>Whereas you ſay, <hi>They were not called Prophets in the old Teſtament from the matter of their propheſie, but for the manner of receiving it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. I anſwer, it was from both matter and manner too.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If what you ſay be truth, ſee a clear difference; thoſe 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. are called Prophets, not ſo much from the manner, as the matter: <hi>He that propheſieth, ſpeaketh to edification, exhortation, and conſolation:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, if you would know a Prophet, it is ſuch a one as ſpeaks <hi>to edification, &amp;c.</hi> and whoſoever ſpeaks not <hi>to edification, &amp;c.</hi> is no <hi>Prophet;</hi> for the Apoſtle doth not only direct them in the manner of propheſie, but in the matter too; its a word to edification; and truly you either miſerably contradict your ſelves, or elſe do of purpoſe to keep ſouls in the dark; for <hi>Thomas Hall,</hi> whom you pretend to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate, applyeth that Scripture 1 Cor. 14. 32. <hi>The ſpirits of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are ſubject to the Prophets: viz. to the probation and examination of the Presbyterie;</hi> and he hath no other Scripture to prove the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian examination and probation,</hi> but that; yet afterwards both with him and you, that propheſie is extraordinary; and yet you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that <hi>Presbyterie</hi> was an ordinary office; what contradictions are theſe, and what will you not ſay for your own ends?</p>
               <p>You ſeem much to harp upon one thing, and that of little conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the thing in hand: <hi>That the extraordinary way of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did denominate their ſayings to be propheſies, and not their foretelling things to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay, that not only that, but the matter of the propheſie, as well as the manner; as a blind man might ſee or underſtand: for if any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, and the matter of the propheſie proved not true, he was no
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:199222:49"/> true Prophet: therefore, that the people might know a true Prophet under the Law, they were to look at the matter of the propheſie, not the manner of receiving it. Iſa. 23. 26. <hi>How long ſhall this be in the heart of the Prophets, to propheſie lies?</hi> ver. 28. <hi>The Prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him ſpeak my word faithfully, &amp;c.</hi> So that it was the faithful and true ſpeaking of the word, from whence they had the denomination of Prophet; and this in ſubſtance you confeſs, <hi>page</hi> 101. contradicting what you ſay, <hi>p.</hi> 100. <hi>It was the extraordinary way of Revelation; here its the manifeſtation of their propheſie, becauſe they manifeſted to others (by divine inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) things paſt, preſent, and to come.</hi> So that now you confeſs its the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation, by revelation of truth, that made them Prophets, not the ordinary way of ſpeaking to edification, &amp;c. mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 3.</p>
               <p>As to all you ſay to <hi>Rev.</hi> 19 10. <hi>page</hi> 103. I may truly retort your own words, <hi>I am afraid the devil hath taught you to play the Sophiſter;</hi> for when the Text ſaith, <hi>The teſtimony of Jeſus is the spirit of propheſie,</hi> you ſay immediatly, <hi>and extraordinarily inſpired:</hi> Doth the Text ſay ſo, or is it your own invention? I leave to the Reader to judge: And as for your diſtinction from <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>The word of God, and the Teſtimony of Jeſus,</hi> its one and the ſame in ſubſtance; or at moſt, the Teſtimony of Jeſus is but an explanation of the word of God: He was baniſhed <hi>for the word of God, even for the Teſtimony of Jeſus,</hi> ſo the Greek word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

So that <hi>John</hi> doth not ſo diſtinguiſh, as if he had been more <hi>excellent then the reſt of the Apoſtles in the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jeſus, &amp;c.</hi> but for that it was he was baniſhed: and the truth is, that the Teſtimony of Jeſus, though not ſo eminent as the Apoſtles, yet if by the ſame ſpirit, according to the rule of truth, and according to the meaſure received, it is <hi>the spirit of propheſie.</hi>

                  <item>Therefore all Prophets.</item>
               </list>
               <p>What you with ſo much contempt ſay to this, doth but diſcover of what ſpirit you are; and you might know, that when I ſay <hi>the Saints are not all Prophets,</hi> page 21. I intended that they had not all the ſame
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:199222:49"/> gift of propheſie, <hi>to ſpeak to the edifying of the Church,</hi> and upon that account they are not all Prophets.</p>
               <p>Yet ſecondly, they are all Prophets upon a common account, and are able to ſpeak ſomething of God and Chriſt, as occaſion is offered; this God promiſed, and hath made good, that he would <hi>pour out of his Spirit upon all fleſh, &amp;c.</hi> So that the truth holds clear, That every ſpiritual man is a Prophet, and that according to the meaſure of the gift, ſo he may, and ought to ſpeak: though all are not Prophets, <hi>viz.</hi> able to ſpeak in the Church to edification, exhortation, and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet all are Prophets, and may ſpeak occaſionally to edification, though not in the Church.</p>
               <p>Some of the grounds you pretend to anſwer, <hi>As that theſe Prophets were ſuch as needed direction from the Apoſtles, &amp;c.</hi> therefore not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary.</p>
               <p>You pretend to anſwer this, firſt, <hi>Becauſe there were extraordinary tongues, and the Apoſtle directs them: and why not direct extraordinary Prophets too?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If by ordinary and extraordinary, you mean the one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all; the other more then ordinary, ſo not common to all; that I alwayes have granted, and ſhall, as in the caſe of propheſying. So of tongues, All have the Spirit of Chriſt; that is ordinary to all: <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8. 9. yet all have not the gift of propheſie, to ſpeak in the Church, as before. So in thoſe tongues there was that ſpeech of the things of God that was ordinary to all, and that of tongues which was proper to but ſome, as Propheſie: yet not ſo extraordinary, as to be either 1. infallible, therefore needed direction: or 2. paſſing; for the Apoſtle <hi>ſpake with tongues more then they all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſecondly, that this of tongues was not ſuch an extraordinary buſineſs as you pretend, is clear; and that firſt from the Apoſtles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading them from it, as you may ſee at large in the Chapter, and that from the unprofitableneſs of it, both to the Church, and to the world too. <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3. and 23, 24.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſaith, ver. 5. <hi>Greater is he that propheſieth then he that ſpeaketh with tongues;</hi> and the reaſon is rendred, becauſe he that propheſieth, <hi>edifieth the Church, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſay there is yet one reaſon more, <hi>page</hi> 87.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Praying and Propheſying are put together</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 5. <hi>Was it extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary praying too?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:199222:50"/>
               <p>You anſwer, <hi>You will put in that too for his Learning.</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 14, 15. <hi>If I pray in an unknown Tongue, &amp;c.</hi> Is not here extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry praying?</p>
               <p>Doth the Scripture call it extraordinary anywhere: and may we not ſay truly, as the Apoſtle ſaith of Propheſie, <hi>greater is he that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecieth, then he that ſpeaketh with tongues?</hi> and the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>he ſpeaketh to edification:</hi> ſo ſay I, greater was, and is he that prayeth in a known tongue, then he that prayeth in an unknown tongue; and the Apoſtle upon the ſame account diſſwades them as well from praying or praiſing in an unknown tongue, as from ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in an unknown tongue; and if that prayer had been extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, ſurely he would not have perſwaded them from it; for I think, that prayer is moſt extraordinary that is moſt prevailing with God, and that is the prayer of Faith; not of an unknown tongue.</p>
               <p>You now come to give your Reaſons, why this Propheſie is extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary: 1. Becauſe it is joyned with extraordinary gifts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>viz. The gift of Tongues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Thoſe gifts as hath been already ſhewed, were not ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary as you pretend. For <hi>greater was be that propheſied then he that ſpake with tongues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But 2. Were what you ſay truth, that <hi>that Propheſy in this Chapter were intermixed with extraordinary gifts as that of tongues;</hi> for which you ſay <hi>its unlikely that Propheſy ſhould be ordinary;</hi> I ſay, were what you ſay in the firſt place truth; yet the ſecond doth not follow. For in Scripture its ordinary to place or intermix thoſe gifts or offices which you call ordinary and extraordinary together; And I wonder you had not ſo much in you as to ſee it; That might have ſaved you the labour of ſetting down this Reaſon. See 1. <hi>Cor</hi> 12 29. <hi>Are all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers? are all Workers of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles? &amp;c</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You affirm <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, Miracles are extraordinary:</hi> and <hi>Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi> placed in the midſt to be ordinary, or by way of ordinary office. So <hi>Rom,</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 8. <hi>v.</hi> 6. he ſpeaks of Propheſy. You ſay that it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary; yet its joyned in with that you call ordinary <hi>Teaching and exhortation. v.</hi> 7, 8. you parallel with it for your proof <hi>Epheſ,</hi> 4. 11. which Scripture makes as much againſt you as any I know when rightly underſtood. For 1. theſe are not extraordinary offices, as is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed at large in the <hi>Pulpit-Guard Routed;</hi> But the ordinary ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gifts and offices in the Church of Chriſt. And Secondly, if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:199222:50"/> upon your own account, Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts which you ſay are extraordinary, are reckoned up with Paſtors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which you ſay are ordinary and continuing offices in the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And 3. I wonder how you dare to divide, and with <hi>Tho. Hall</hi> to pick out what you pleaſe; and to call one ordinary, and another extraordinary: when the Scripture preſents them all as ſtanding in the Church upon the ſame account, gifts given forth by the Spirit from Chriſt to the Church. And you would take ſome, and leave o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; ſo rob the Church of Chriſt of thoſe gifts, orders, Priviledges and Officers that Chriſt hath given to it; but no wonder; for you own neither Church, Ordinances, Gifts or Officers according to the mind of Chriſt, but what you have received by Tradition, from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt.</p>
               <p>You ſay that he ſayth, <hi>Apoſtles are not extraordinary; and as for Evangeliſts, he hath nothing to ſay of them &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truly, had you not been blind or forgetfull, there is enough ſaid of them. It ſeems I muſt ſay it again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 70. <hi>An Evangeliſt is not an extraordinary, but an ordinary work; a cryer or publiſher of glad tydings;</hi> which is proper to all the ſervants of the Lord, that preach glad tydings to men; and as for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, they are not extraordinary, but ordinary; I ſay it again, and I wonder you durſt to oppoſe ſo clear a truth; thoſe who are ſent of God to preach the Goſpel for converting ſouls, and gathering Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, are Apoſtles, <hi>viz.</hi> ſent ones; and the Twelve Apoſtles did not take their denomination from their extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, but from their miſſion from Chriſt to do his work; ſo that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding none are ſo ſent as thoſe Apoſtles were; 1. immediately or by an immediate miſſion from his own mouth. 2. So immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired and abilitated from above; nor 3. to do the ſame work in every particular, though the ſame in ſubſtance; <hi>viz.</hi> to be the firſt Planters of the Goſpel, to eſtabliſh it by ſigns and miracles, &amp;c. Yet there is the ſame in truth; and men ſent for the gathering of Churches are as truly Apoſtles as they were: as the ſons of God are as truly the ſons of God as Chriſt himſelf, though not filled with the ſame full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And that you may ſee there were more Apoſtles then thoſe, Chriſt was the great Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 1. and he ſent the Twelve; and other Apoſtles its more then probable there were. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 7. the Scripture ſaith that <hi>Andronicus and Junias were of note among the Apoſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:199222:51"/>
               <p n="1">1. Its probable that they were Apoſtles &amp;c. elſe how ſhould they be of note or reckoned among them?</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there were Apoſtles there; and it could not be of the Twelve. For <hi>Paul</hi> was the only Apoſtle to the Gentiles, and the others of the Circumciſion; they were of note among the Apoſtles of or belonging to the Church in <hi>Rome.</hi> But Secondly, Its apparent that there are or ſhall be both Apoſtles and Prophets at the Fall of <hi>Babylon:</hi> which work I believe is now begun: and the Lord hath his <hi>ſent ones</hi> abroad in the World, in and by whom he will effect his work; who ſhall rejoyce in the fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> Rev. 18. 20. <hi>Rejoyce over her ye holy Apoſtles and Prophets, for God hath avenged you on her.</hi> So that notwithſtanding all your ſcuffling ſhifts you make to help your ſelf, and to keep up your honour with the people; yet know that God is truth, and every man that oppoſeth him ſhall be found a lyar; and that he hath left theſe ordinary ſtanding gifts and offices in his Church, <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors, Teachers, &amp;c.</hi> And whereas you ſay that I argue againſt it, <hi>p.</hi> 70. that thoſe <hi>ſcattered brethren,</hi> Act. 8. <hi>were not Apoſtles, though ſent to gather Saints, &amp;c.</hi> That I ſay is (as a blind man may underſtand) that they were none of the twelve Apoſtles; for they tarried at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> in anſwer to <hi>Tho. Halls</hi> aſſertion, that they might be Apoſtles; whereas it is ſaid that the Apoſtles <hi>tarried at Jeruſalem:</hi> but that they were Apoſtles, <hi>viz.</hi> ſent forth by the Lord, not in a common way, though not of the twelve Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Reaſon, <hi>Becauſe this word</hi> Prophet <hi>hath been alwayes uſed to ſignifie a perſon extraordinarily inſpired of God, when taken in a good ſenſe, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe Prophets were ordinarily taken in this ſenſe in the Old Teſtament, and ſometimes ſo taken in the New Teſtament; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to conclude they were alwayes ſo taken, is a <hi>Non ſequitur,</hi> and there is no ground for it; no more then becauſe in the Old Teſtament all were circumciſed, in the New Teſtament ſome were circumciſed, therefore all muſt be circumciſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Uſually theſe extraordinary Prophets, as you call them, had their Propheſies written, and they were kept upon record for after-times: but amongſt ſo many Prophets in every Church, none of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies are recorded, therefore no extraordinary Prophets. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they were not extraordinary, is cleer, in that their Doctrine was to be tryed by the Church, or at leaſt by the reſt of the Prophets;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:199222:51"/> and this you never find done by any of the extraordinary Prophets. And laſtly, if they had been extraordinary, they could rather have directed the Apoſtle, then the Apoſtle ſhould have directed them, as <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 11. Which arguments were urged in the <hi>Pulpit-Guard Routed;</hi> but you were ſo wiſe, it ſeems, as to take no notice of them.</p>
               <p>I might add to all the reſt, that the extraordinary Propheſie was ſuch an immediate revelation and inſpiration, as that when it came, they could not but propheſie. This was ſuch a propheſie, as they had firſt need to be exhorted to it, and ſecondly are bid to deſire it, and thirdly had need to be informed of their liberty, and fourthly to be directed unto the right manner of the performing of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 1, 2. &amp; 31. &amp; 29. 30. therefore no extraordinary, but ordinary Prophets. Theſe things thus conſidered, I queſtion not but that it ſufficiently makes null your ſecond Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Your third Argument is, <hi>That the gift or ſpirit of Propheſie given out to the New Teſtament Prophets, is the fulfilling of the promiſe,</hi> Joel 2. 28. <hi>therefore extraordinary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Granted that it is the ſame ſpirit, and fulfilling of the ſame promiſe, yet not the ſame extraordinary gift. If no Prophets but thoſe who have extraordinary gifts, then no Paſtors and Teachers; for then they had extraordinary gifts; and upon the ſame account thoſe who have not the like gifts are not Paſtors and Teachers; upon the ſame account no believers. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 17. <hi>Theſe ſigns ſhall follow them that believe,</hi> &amp;c. So that upon this account you will reaſon out all Religion and Chriſtianity out of the world.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſecondly, they having the Spirit, or the gifts and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Spirit, might in their Propheſies be above us: yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure received, we may, nay ought, <hi>viz.</hi> the Prophets, to ſpeak in the Church, &amp;c. Or elſe that propheſie <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 28. hath nothing to do with us, nor we with it, we are not under that promiſe; ſo all the promiſes are not in Chriſt <hi>yea and amen</hi> to us. And how dare you to make null the great Goſpel propheſie and promiſe, nay the great and bleſſed promiſe of Chriſt at his departure from his Diſciples <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 16. <hi>viz.</hi> of the Spirit?</p>
               <p>Your fourth Argument is, <hi>Becauſe Propheſie is ſet down diſtinct from ordinary Teaching,</hi> Rom. 12. 6.</p>
               <p>A little to diſcover the ſtrength of this Argument, I reaſon thus: Exhortation in the ſame place is ſet down diſtinct from Teaching, therefore it is extraordinary Exhortation. Therefore I have in the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:199222:52"/> 
                  <hi>Pulpit Guard Routed,</hi> cleerly diſtinguiſhed between Gift and Office; and if the Lord enlighten us in theſe, that we could but diſtinguiſh, we ſhould not thus confound one thing with another, and turn out ſome truths to retain others; but every truth would ſtand in its place, and ſo there would be a ſweet harmony, as in Scripture, ſo in the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Your fifth Argument is, <hi>Becauſe the gift of Propheſie was given to others beſides Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is learned Logick indeed: Becauſe wicked men have the uſe of the things of the world, therefore it is not proper to all the Saints to have the uſe of the things of the world: becauſe wicked men may have the ſpirit of Propheſie, therefore it is not proper to the Saints to have it. Let the Reader judge of this Logick. Or elſe becauſe wicked men may have a form of godlineſs, denying the power; therefore it is not proper to all the Saints to have the form of godlineſs. This Argument I leave to the Reader; and follow you to your other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe God hath not appointed all gifted brethren to live of the Gospel, therefore they are not to preach the Gospel.</hi> The Scripture you produce is 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 9. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Scripture is to be underſtood in way of diſtinction; and that,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they that preach the Goſpel, may, not that they muſt, live of the Goſpel: then <hi>Paul</hi> lived unlawfully, when he wrought with his hands, <hi>Act</hi> 18. 3. and his hands miniſtred to his neceſſities; and <hi>it is a more bleſſed thing to give then to receive.</hi> So that it is only a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the mind of God, what he that preaches the Goſpel may do, if he need it. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, he had a power not to work, but to live of the Goſpel; and he had a power to work, and not to live of the Goſpel. But it ſeems you are very loth to heare on that eare.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It intends that only thoſe who are called to the office, and ſet apart wholly to that work, that they ſhould, if they need, live of the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17, 18 You never read that Prophets were to live of the Goſpel. So that this diſtinction keeps the truth cleer, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves your Argument to nothing.</p>
               <p>Your ſecond Argument, is <hi>Becauſe to preach publiquely, is to exerciſe authority: But none may exerciſe authority, but ſuch as have Miniſterial authority, &amp;c.</hi> The Scripture for confirmation of this, is 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 2. 12.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:199222:52"/> where <hi>Women are forbidden to teach publikely, becauſe they may not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurp authority over the man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Argument and Scripture will do you no good to that end for which you have produced it; but cleerly contradicts that you drive at: for the Apoſtle both in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 34. &amp; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12. holds forth the difference in generall between men and women in the Church, not between women and men in office; that is non-ſenſe; for he ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 35. <hi>If the woman will know any thing, let her ask her husband at home.</hi> There is no ſuch word ſpoken of the men. So that men have authority to ſpeak in the Church to edification, having the gift; but women have not that authority allowed them, although they have the gift, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Your third Argument. <hi>If there be a power in the Church to keep off wolves and falſe teachers from the ſheep; then all that conceive they have gifts, may not preach, till they are approved, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is granted that there is ſuch a power in the Church of Chriſt; and they are able to judge of gifts, when they hear, whether it be of God or of man; and they muſt hear, before they can judge: And when they hear and judge that it is of God; not a wolf, but a ſheep; not a falſe, but a true Prophet, ſpeaking to <hi>edification, exhortation, and conſolation,</hi> they may with comfort hear and approve the ſpeaking of ſuch in the Church.</p>
               <p>Your fourth Argument, is; <hi>If to appoint to the office of a Miniſter, and the work of a Miniſter be all one, then no man is appointed to the work of a Miniſter, but he that is appointed to the office. But to appoint to the office of a Miniſter, and the work of a Miniſter, be all one.</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Your <hi>Minor</hi> is denied. A man may be appointed to the work of a Miniſter, yet never be appointed to the office. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Richard Sanders</hi> himſelf in his own practiſe ſhall confute this Logick; for he ſaith, <hi>That he Preached a long time before he was Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,</hi> &amp;c. but he mends the matter, <hi>It was in order to the Miniſtry.</hi> But in caſe <hi>Richard Sanders</hi> had died before he had been ordained, then Preaching and the Office of the Miniſtry had not been one, there had been a great deal of Preaching without Office. So that in this your practiſe you contradict your reaſon, and you allowed your ſelf in the thing which you condemn.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Were theſe <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 4. appointed to the office? they did the work: but the office you read not of. And thoſe 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10, 11.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:199222:53"/> they were commanded to the work, but not to the office; for then every one muſt have been officers, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You have given your Argument, but never a Scripture to confirm it; but you endeavour to confirm one Reaſon by another, without Scripture. Take heed, <hi>Richard,</hi> of outing Scripture with your Reaſon; be content to fall down under the power of truth; let God be true, and all fleſhes wiſdom, ſo far as it oppoſeth God, be a lye.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>That Humane Learning is no way neceſſary to the Miniſtry of the Goſpel; and that I affirm,</hi> p. 38. 39. 41. <hi>Pulpit-Guard Routed, that the power of the Spirit of Chriſt in Saints, is ſufficiently able to make them to divide the word aright, and to convince gain-ſayers.</hi>

               <p>And dare you deny this Truth? Is not the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent? dare you derogate from the Holy Spirit? and do you find any other Miniſtery or Teacher then the Spirit in the Scripture? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 26. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16. 7, 8. But you ſeem to help this again; you deny not the ability of the Spirit; but you queſtion <hi>the will, or if he pleaſe to do it.</hi> I think that needs not be the Queſtion, but rather whether you are in the Scripture directed to any other way for the attaining of the minde of God then the Spirit and the Scripture; but you queſtion, pag. 126. <hi>Whether the main and principle Doctrine of the Scriptures be ſo plainly laid down, as that a Chriſtian may attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the knowledge of the ſame without humane Learning;</hi> you grant, that if he <hi>have a Tranſlation he may:</hi> and have not we a Tranſlation in <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and is it not true, but falſe? then the Tranſlators have done wrong: but is it not true in the ſubſtance? is there any material, fundamental miſtake? if not, then an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation may underſtand the minde of God as much and more, if he have a greater meaſure of the Spirit, then an <hi>Hebritian</hi> and <hi>Grecian</hi> can underſtand in thoſe Languages. 2. I anſwer, that I do not quarrell againſt Tongues, but at the abuſe of them, to make an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol of them: I know you may come to the knowledge of the Letter of Scripture in an ordinary way more fully with it then without it; but it is the abuſe of it that I quarrel at, becauſe you ſet it up in the room of the Spirit, as if none could underſtand Scripture but thoſe that have Tongues; then the Faith of all others muſt be an implicite Faith, built upon the credit of men, which would prove very weak in the end.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:199222:53"/>
               <p n="3"> 3. Its the uſe of Philoſophy in the things of God, as ſome of you affirm, that there is a neceſſity of <hi>ſtudying Arts, Sciences, Logick, Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, &amp;c.</hi> to make them Miniſters, as <hi>Tho.

                  <hi>a Rock,</hi> you ſeem to give a learned interpretation, as if Chriſt intended to build his Church upon <hi>Peter;</hi> ſo much is clearly hinted in what you ſay. I trace you no farther in this; I leave the weight of what you ſay concerning thoſe Scriptures, to the Reader, becauſe I am in haſte. As to that you ſay concerning Ghoſt, I perceive you know well what the word is in the Greek; and what if it were alwayes ſo tranſlated in Engliſh? and I think it is one of the greateſt wrongs to our Engliſh tranſlation, the miſpronouncing of words, in pronouncing Hebrew and Greek inſtead of Engliſh; <hi>Meſſias</hi> from <hi>Meſha,</hi> inſtead of Anointed: Emmanuel inſtead of God with us: In Greek Chriſt from <hi>Chriſtos,</hi> inſtead of anointed; <hi>Jeſus</hi> inſtead of Saviour; <hi>Apoſtle</hi> inſtead of Sent; <hi>Baptize</hi> inſtead of Dip or Waſh, &amp;c. and Ghoſt inſtead of Spirit, though thats no Greek word. Why do you not reform theſe things with your learning, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be done on purpoſe to keep people in ignorance?</p>
               <p>But you have ſomething farther to ſay it ſeems, and that very learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, <hi>page</hi> 134. and you have much to ſay to this particular; <hi>That there is not any Scripture underſtood by ſpiritual Chriſtians, the gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical ſenſe of which, a man that hath not the Spirit of Chriſt may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto; and</hi> page 135. <hi>That Scripture is ſufficient to diſcover its own</hi>

                  <hi>ſenſe to all men, diligently improving the outward helps afforded by God; and that if it be the Spirits work to diſcover the ſenſe and meaning of Scripture, then the Spirits work is to make Notioniſts, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> And is this your ſpiritualneſs indeed? That a natural man without the Spirit may underſtand the mind of God? for if he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſenſe and meaning of the Scripture, then he underſtands the mind of God; and this is contrary to the Scripture, <hi>For the natural man doth not underſtand the things that are of God, neither can he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14, <hi>But we have the mind of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If this be truth that you affirm, then what is the reaſon that you, with all your humane Learning, do not yet underſtand the ſenſe and meaning of the Scripture? and that firſt in common and ordinary things, as that the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moſes, &amp;c.</hi> is not the ſame as the Goſpel-Covenant; when the Scripture ſaith plainly that it is not the ſame, <hi>but another Covenant, not ſuch a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant as the firſt was, but eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes, &amp;c.</hi> What is the reaſon that you do not underſtand that Command of Chriſt, that it is Believers that are to be baptized, and not Infants? and that you underſtand not, that when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>That upon this Rock will I build my Church,</hi> he means not <hi>Peter,</hi> but the Rock of <hi>Peters</hi> confeſſion; <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, who is ſo often in Scripture called <hi>The Rock or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation ſtone of Sion:</hi> but Pope-like, think its meant of <hi>Peter.</hi> And are there not many Propheſies, and much of the Revelation which is yet a ſealed myſterie to you? and <hi>John</hi> ſaith expreſly, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>viz</hi> Chriſt the myſterie of God in Scripture, <hi>is a ſealed book, that none could open it but the Lion of the Tribe of Judah.</hi> Yet you ſay, that a natural man can do it.

               <p>And whereas you are ſo much upon this, <hi>That the Scripture expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are plain, and expreſs their own meaning,</hi> page 137. <hi>Elſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a perfect rule; and if men muſt underſtand them by or in the light or teaching of the Spirit, what were this but to make the Scripture a noſe of Wax, as the Papiſts do, plyable to any ſenſe, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Its true, the Scripture expreſſions are plain, and expreſs their own meaning: yet not ſo plain as you pretend, that every one may attain the ſenſe of them; for you confeſs, that there is need of means and help to underſtand them. Then I querie which is the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt means to help us to underſtand the meaning of the Scripture, in comparing Scripture with Scripture; the Spirit of Chriſt, or humane Learning? Who beſt knows the meaning of the Scripture? that Spirit by which it was given, or that humane ſpirit ſo much pleaded for, that never did, nor never ſhall know the Lord?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Scriptures are no perfect rule to ignorant and carnal men, or hypocrites: its a perfect rule only to ſuch who by them know the Lord and his mind by the teachings of the Spirit, and ſo walk accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it; for if it be a perfect rule, then its ſo to thoſe who know it.</p>
               <p>You ſay a naturall man may know it; then a naturall man may have a perfect rule; and if he walk according to it, he muſt be ſaved; for who ſo walks by a perfect rule, and anſwers it in his walking, muſt be juſtified by that rule: Now the Scripture is no perfect rule of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of life to any but the Saints; not that there is imperfection in the Scripture; but none comes truly to know it, but thoſe who are taught from above.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To ſay, that the knowledge of the mind of God in Scripture, by the teachings of the Spirit, <hi>is to make it a noſe of Wax, &amp;c.</hi> is a fond imagination. For firſt, though its true, upon this account men that have not the Spirit of God may abuſe it, thinking they have the Spirit of Chriſt, when they have it not.</p>
               <p>Yet 2. The Spirit is truth, and is at unity in and with it ſelf, and ſpeaks but one thing: I mean he doth not contradict himſelf: though there are contradictions amongſt the Saints: yet it is not from the

               <p>And 2. Doth not your humane wiſdom indeed <hi>make a noſe of wax of the Scripture?</hi> do you not wreſt i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Is it not about the ſenſe of the Scriptures all the differences in the world are at this day? And do you ſeek to God to guide you into a oneneſs in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the meaning of it, or to your humane Learning?</p>
               <p>Oh be aſhamed for ever, ſo much to undervalue Scripture, and overvalue mans wiſdom, as that its ſufficient to find out the meaning of the Scriptures. When you have joyned up all together, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all your Learning, yea, and the Spirits teaching too, you have not yet attained to all the ſenſe of the Scriptures; if you had, there would not be diviſion, but unity; not that I queſtion the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of the Spirits teaching in its own time; but certainly you are very much to blame, having gotten that which is able to teach you the ſenſe and meaning of the Scripture, with your own endeavour, yet to know ſo little of it as you do; you muſt needs be very ſluggards, or elſe able to reſolve (infallibly) any place of Scripture, you having that which is able, as you ſay, to help you to underſtand it, and you think you have the Spirit of Chriſt beſides; theſe two being by you joyned up together in you, the leaſt of which is able to help you to the infallible ſenſe, &amp;c. What then hinders that you are not infallible? and yet that you are not infallible, is clear; for what need a difference then between <hi>Papiſt</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> yet both Learned? between <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacie</hi> and <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> yet both Learned? <hi>Presbyterie</hi> and <hi>Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> yet both Learned? <hi>Independency</hi> and the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> yet ſome of both Learned? between them all, and thoſe that deny both Church and Ordinances, yet ſome of them Learned too?</p>
               <p>Oh be aſhamed for ever of theſe Fopperies, and let all who know the Lord, look to him for the teachings of the Spirit, that ſo we may come to know his minde and will, that ſo we may worſhip him with one ſhoulder; and let all that love the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſay <hi>Amen.</hi> This ſhall ſuffice at preſent as an anſwer to what you ſay of your hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a dangerous one with you it ſeems; but becauſe I have ſaid ſo much to this in the <hi>Pulpit Guard Routed,</hi> I ſhall wholly wave it in this place, ſeaving both <hi>Tho. Halls</hi> aſſertions, my anſwers to him and yours again to mine, to the judgment of the Reader; a word to the wiſe is enough; its a word that you cannot yet well bear, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall at preſent forbear; only give me leave to minde you with two words, 1. You anſwer but one of my ſix Arguments to prove them <hi>Antichriſtian;</hi> the reſt you paſs by, as if the naming of them (as <hi>Tho. Hall</hi> ſaid) in contempt, were anſwer enough to them; if it be, I leave it to the Reader, I am ſatisfied. 2. In that which you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to anſwer, what do you more or leſs, then ſay the ſame that I have ſaid? You confeſs, 1. It came from <hi>Rome;</hi> but you think to mend it with this, becauſe the Scriptures came from <hi>Rome;</hi> but if by the hand of Gods grace the Scripture was kept pure in <hi>Rome</hi> and not defiled, then the caſe is altered; but they were ſo kept. <hi>Ergo:</hi> that it is ſo, I prove;</p>

               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> I prove. Thoſe who uſe to corrupt Scripture, do it for their own ends and intereſts; but the Papiſts have not corrupted it for their own ends and intereſts: <hi>Ergo.</hi> I mean in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> which I ſuppoſe muſt neceſſarily be that which you intend; for you ſay the Scriptures as well as Ordination, was very much corrupted by the Papiſts, <hi>p.</hi> 169. but among us hath been reſtored by degrees; now our Work hath not been to reſtore the Popiſh Tranſlators, but to Tranſlate out of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copies, which I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve were, or are materially or ſubſtantially corrupted; ſo that by this you teach the People to deny the Scripture; and at beſt to take it upon the account of man reducing it from corruption. I muſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:199222:56"/> tell you if the <hi>Collier</hi> had written as much, as black as you make him, he muſt have expected to have had all the black-Coats in the Nation about his ears, and that juſtly too.</p>
               <p>So that the Caſe is altered now; the Scripture in its eſſence was kept pure; but the very eſſence of Ordination was <hi>Antichriſtian;</hi> and how you could bring a clean thing out of an unclean, I leave to the Reader to judge. As to the Argument, you confeſs the truth of it, that the Calling came from <hi>Rome,</hi> but you reſtore it by degrees: Now which is better, to come to the Scripture for Ordination, Ordinances, &amp;c. or to retain that which is <hi>Antichriſtian:</hi> I leave to the Reader to judge; as for <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk, you confeſs what I ſay; only you think you mend the matter, in ſaying that Monks were not ſo bad then as now, and that <hi>Rome</hi> was a true Church then; the truth of this I leave to the judgement of the wiſe; theſe things conſidered;</p>
               <p n="1">1. When <hi>Auſtin</hi> came into <hi>England,</hi> here was ſome that owned <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as Hiſtory relates; for as you ſay the Goſpel had been preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>England</hi> before both by <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> and afterward <hi>Lucius</hi> King of the <hi>Britains</hi> deſiring it, not <hi>Elutherius</hi> as you affirm, but <hi>Fugatius</hi> and <hi>Damianus</hi> being ſent by <hi>Elutherius</hi> Pope or Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> they Preached and Baptized in <hi>England,</hi> that King being the firſt King that Hiſtory mentions that was Baptized in <hi>England;</hi> but when <hi>Auſtin</hi> came, thoſe Biſhops you mention with the People, becauſe they would not ſubmit to the pride of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> were by him perſecuted, and brought to ruine: by this you may judge a little of the truth of <hi>Romes</hi> being a true Church, and <hi>Auſtin</hi> a true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas you ſay, <hi>You hope Rome was then a true Church.</hi> I ſay, you have but little ground for it; for I do not believe that ever <hi>Rome</hi> was a true Church. My Reaſon is, becauſe I do judge, that never a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Province or City, was a true Goſpel-Church; its true there was once a true Church in <hi>Rome,</hi> but the Scripture never calls <hi>Rome</hi> a Church; for a true Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are a People gathered out of the world by the power of the Goſpel, to believing in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and profeſſed obedience to him; but this was never any Nation, Province, or City; therefore no true Church of Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 9 but ſuch Churches were at firſt, and ſo it hath hitherto continued, gathered by the authority of the Civil Magiſtrate, compelling all to come in, or elſe they muſt not live under their Authority, fulfilling in a meaſure <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 17. by which means the true Church in <hi>Rome,</hi> and all other
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:199222:56"/> true Churches, in Relation to Form, Order and Worſhip, have been extinguiſhed; ſo that I ſay, <hi>Rome</hi> was never a true Church ſince it became a Church, nor any Nation in the World beſides; its incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the true Church of Chriſt, who are a People gathered out of Nations, as before, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But to draw to a concluſion; The other five Arguments you paſs over, as having no weight in them, &amp;c. I leave it to the Reader to judge, if there be no weight in them. I ſay no more, only aword to your Poſtſcript.</p>
               <p>You ſay, <hi>There is another dangerous peſtilent blaſphemous Book of this Colliers againſt Ordinances, &amp;c. which you heard of, but never ſaw it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſuppoſe you did but dream a ſecond time, and this proves falſe too; give off dreaming or lying for ſhame; for I ſuppoſe none dare lye ſo groſly as to tell you ſo, though you dare dream a lye and publiſh it; but there is a hand of God in it, that the world may know what you are. My Books are not in private; if there were any ſuch, it might be gotten aſſuredly; let this ſatisfie, I do declare that I never writ any ſuch Book; and if any have done or do gather from any paſſage that I deny Ordinances; though I know no paſſage in any, from whence any can draw ſuch a poſitive concluſion: I do affirm, that I never writ any thing in which I denyed the Ordinances of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and it is my judgement and practiſe to walk in the uſe of them. Thus at preſent have I done, leaving the Premiſes to the publick view and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of thoſe to whom it comes, deſiring the Lord to give under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, &amp;c.</p>
